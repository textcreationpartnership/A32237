            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Upon this account let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our own weakneſs, which being not able to comprehend the cauſe of Events, does term them accidental or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58553:8"/>caſual. With this pretext the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Wits have endeavoured to excuſe their errours, and the moſt renown'd Captains to comfort themſelves for the loſs of their Battels: For the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians deſcribing the advantages of the ground of which they had made choice, the exquiſite order of their Armies, their Retrenchments, their Bodies of Reſerve, and all the other circumſtances, which denote the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of brave Commanders; then having ſpoken of their famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits with aſtoniſhment, at laſt do accuſe malicious <hi>Fortune</hi> for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſucceſs, which humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome knew not how to prevent.

On the contrary, I conceive that we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of our own Fortune, and our good or bad Conduct is often the ſource of our good or evil, without ſeeking a more remote cauſe. I muſt confeſs, that the moſt piercing Wits, who ſeem to know things perfectly, and to their very roots, do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſee their own affairs proſper; becauſe they depend from many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different Cauſes, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible by the force of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to penetrate: and foraſmuch as we know nothing but by our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which deceive us every moment, how can we judge truly of what will befal us? and what certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences can we draw from ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain principles? The <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> had ſo bad an opinion of them, that they taught, that humane Senſe was altogether uncapable of knowledge; that we were not aſſured of any thing we ſaw with our eyes, or heard with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58553:9"/>our cars; that our Diſcourſe and Reaſon, which proceed only from the Idea's, which external Objects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our Senſes, were nothing elſe but Errour and Illuſion. We muſt not therefore be amaz'd, if E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents deceive us, ſeeing we know not their Principles and Cauſes: yet we may reaſonably ſay, that although our Senſes ſometimes deceive us, yet experience teaches us, that they do not always ſo: and the moſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and underſtanding perſons being happily endow'd with an excellent diſpoſition of Organs, and an exact temperament of Body, have brighter lights, and a more diſtinct knowledge of Affairs, than other men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently are the ſeldomeſt miſtaken in their judgements, and not ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thoſe unexpected accidents, which the Antients called <hi>Fortune.</hi>

I ſpeak of that ſhameful Poverty, which deprives us of the Means of ſhewing our Parts, debaſes our Spirits, ſuffocates our good Qualifications in the preſs of the Rabble, and by deſtroying in us theſe advantages of Nature, hinder us from raiſing our ſelves to the pitch of Virtue. I know there is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and Evangelical Poverty, which having God for its Object, takes no care to abound in earthly Riches; but theſe perfect Souls, which we admire as above the World, and who poſſeſs nothing in particular, yet do not refuſe to enjoy the Benefit and Revenues of their eſtates in common. The Magnificence of their Temples and Monaſteries is not inferiour to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58553:12"/>the Beauty of Princes Palaces; and not withſtanding they renounce the property, yet they reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Profits. God gave us our life, but Nature as the ſecond Cauſe has faſtened many inconveniencies to it, which we are oblig'd to overcome for our own preſervation; her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection is communicated to our eſſence. Hunger and Thirſt are two mortal Maladies; we heal them with Pleaſure, by uſing thoſe remedies which are appropriated to them: Cold is an enemy to our natural Heat; our Clothes and Houſes defend us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Men may tell me, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages live as long as we do, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more happily, without perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with acquiring many things, which coſt us much trouble, and yet are not more neceſſary for us than for them. I own it, and cannot blame them: If I was a Savage, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they would have yet greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to tell me ſo; but that man muſt be mad, who lives after the manner of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages among people that are not ſo.

For my part, I yield to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſentiment of the Vulgar, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem thoſe happieſt, who are born Rich, and have their extraction from a Noble Family; if theſe be of a fit diſpoſition to accompliſh themſelves, they cannot want Guides to direct them in the paths of Honour: Their Name alone opens to them the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of Princes; their Virtue mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts it ſelf without others aſſiſtance; they do that with great eaſe, which a poor Gentleman cannot do, but with extream trouble: Nay, if they want Wit, their Riches make them courted, and their Birth reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Theſe being the two Golden Calves which the Common people worſhip; and if they be not born to be accompliſht perſons, gallant or honeſt men, yet they are in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do good to ſuch as are ſo; and being not able to attain to Virtue themſelves, may entertain in their Retinue thoſe that are. At Court we ſeldom ſee a Perſon of Quality, Merit and Riches, without great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58553:14"/>and great Employs: <hi>Fortune,</hi> as malicious as ſhe is, does never in the leaſt oppoſe his advancement, when he has wherewithal to pleaſe Soverain Powers. I know that good qualifications are requiſite for this purpoſe: for I do not pretend here to make an honeſt or gallant man; I ſuppoſe he is that already, and has no need of any thing but conduct to arrive at his end. I will only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that Wealth and Birth do infinitely contribute to the rendring us happy, and to the obtaining of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſuitable to the Quality of a Gentleman. If any one objects, that Riches may be prejudicial; I anſwer, that if he looks upon the right bias of the thing, the error proceeds from us, and not from them; they are good of themſelves, and nothing is hurtful but the bad uſe we make of them. The commendation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, with which we meet ſo often in the Writings of the Antient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, is a Paradox more proper to exerciſe the vivacity and ſharpneſs of their Wits, than to convince us of the truth thereof. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58553:14"/>have Philoſophiz'd of it very much at their eaſe, being the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men of <hi>Greece</hi> both for their Birth and for their Employments. <hi>Seneca</hi> extols it highly in the midſt of a vaſt abundance; and though he ſo often inſinuates, nay inculcates into us the contentedneſs of his Spirit, yet did not die without great ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having had a deſigne of ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in the Throne of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Benefactor. Without doubt a Gentleman born rich and of a good Family has no reaſon to complain of <hi>Fortune:</hi> if he continues in the Country, ſhe is not obliged to go finde him out there: He ought to ſhow himſelf at the King's Court; there it is that he can hope to raiſe himſelf above others his equals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding he knows two things: The firſt is, the inclination and humour of his Maſter; the ſecond is, his own inclination, and natural diſpoſition.</p>

We have in our time ſeen a perſon rais'd to the dignity of Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> for having taught Magpies to flye at Sparrows; and others from Pages become Dukes and Peers; and in former Ages thoſe who could cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly manage the intrigue of a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-head, have made themſelves great Lords by it. I ſay again, that a Gentleman who deſignes to raiſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58553:15"/>his Fortunes at the Court, muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtand his own natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; becauſe it is impoſſible to divert his Prince, if he takes no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf in what he does.

We are not maſters of the Appetites which Nature has inſpired into us; and whatſoever pains we take to ſuppreſs them, our diſcontent will ſometimes appear, and make all our forced complaiſance ineffectual. I may aſſert the ſame of the War, which I have of Hunting; we ought to perceive in our ſelves courage to deſpiſe dangers, vigor to endure the toils of the Army, and ambition to aſpire to great Charges: without

It would be a very inconſiderable buſineſs, if we ſhould rencounter no other obſtacles but hazards. A man is not to complain when he dies in the purſuit of his ends: the ſame end which limits his life, terminates likewiſe his Deſignes, his Hopes, and his Fortune: There are two other things which do more incommode him; the firſt is, that his advancement depends from the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs of Battels, of which all humane Prudence is not ſufficient to aſſure us: The laſt is, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to have a Patron of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Cabinet, without whom his ſervices will not finde that juſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58553:16"/>reception they deſerve: it is true, that it is a hard matter to ſurmount theſe two difficulties which render this way by War to great honours very uncertain, and at laſt the Rewards are in the hands of the Soveraign: if he delights in War, he does often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to himſelf the happy ſucceſs of his Arms, which he frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in perſon; and when bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs happens, the Officers of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my are hardly put to't to defend themſelves a gainſt his anger and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches. But if he be addicted to his Pleaſures more than to his Affairs, he ſees almoſt nothing but with the eyes of his Favourite, who repreſents the Actions of every man in thoſe colours that pleaſe him beſt; and having abandon'd all his Authority at his Councils, he muſt of neceſſity become a Slave to his Miniſters. Therefore after this manner a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ought to employ his policie; and if he builds upon any other foundation, he has often for the only recompence of his famous Exploits an Arm of iron, or a Leg of wood. I ſpeak of ſuch Gentlemen only,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58553:17"/>who make great Dignities the Object of their Archiovments. I know there are many, who go into the Field on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gain eſteem, and to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they are men of Courage; which indeed, is a du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I add further, they are oblig'd to attempt ſomething bravely by their own hands, to eſtabliſh their Reputation. It is not ſufficient never to have been guilty of any ignoble Act; the world thinks it obliges us very much, in ſpeaking well of the Virtues we have made appear, without making Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks to our advantage.

               <p>THe other way of advancing a man's Fortune by applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the perſon of the Prince, is to contribute to his divertiſements, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is indeed the moſt caſie, and the moſt infallible: the great ſecret is to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf agreeable, to uſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, and be diligent, and very expert in thoſe Exerciſes in which he chiefly delights; which ought to be manag'd with ſuch diſcretion, that no opportunitie muſt be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58553:18"/>of giving him all the advantage at them, and never to maintain any thing obſtinately againſt him. It is likewiſe a prudent part in a Courtier to looſe ſometimes at Play on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to put his Maſter in a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: For to command is ſuch an innate quality in Princes, that they cannot permit without regret that any perſon ſhould out do them. Theſe precepts are alſo more neceſſary to be obſerved in converſation, which ought always to be with reſpect; and if there be an occaſion of contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it be done in ſuch terms as propound our Opinion only, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh it. The moſt gallant things looſe their luſtre, when ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably; and men are not eaſily convinc'd of any thing by others diſputing too imperiouſly; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo frequently uſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requires our greateſt circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Every man is ſatisfi'd of his own Senſe and Underſtanding, and it is this which makes us ſo outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt thoſe who pretend to have more than our ſelves. Truly there is nothing more irkſome than
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58553:18"/>to give car to thoſe people who have ſeen every thing, who underſtand every thing, and who have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing. A Gallant and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht perſon ought not to relate his own deeds; he that cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear doing it, paſſes ordinarily for ridiculous, and is accounted but a lyer: if we have performed worthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

I will not adviſe one to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prince: Flattery is ſo baſe a thing, that it is unworthy of a perſon of Honour; but I do very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, that we ſhould entertain him with ſome obliging diſcourſe, and praiſe that in which he moſt delights, and which he beſt underſtands: In doing which, the air of the Action contributes extreamly to the inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating us into his favour. Indeed the Reſpect that is due to his Perſon, obliges us to baniſh our ill humour from his preſence. There are I know not what ſpirits in our eyes, which imprint their qualities on thoſe that behold us: If we are dull,

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58553:19"/>affection, if they look upon us with love?</p>
               <p>Nature has made ſome men ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; theſe are happy, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do but let her act free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But if ſhe has made us melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick, let us correct her imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by habituating our ſelves to mirth and gayety; and by keeping a continual guard, we ſhall at laſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail againſt them. <hi>Socrates</hi> conſented to him that judged of his manners by his Phyſiognomy, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was naturally inclin'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, but the Precepts of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy had made him vertuous.

                     <hi>Ut amêris, ama.</hi>
                  </note> we can hardly deny him our affection. This Compaſſion extends it ſelf even to Beaſts. In <hi>Holland</hi> I ſaw a Maſtiff make his fortune: This poor Dog ſingled out the late Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the midſt of his Army before <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht;</hi> and notwithſtanding that the Guards often beat him away, yet he always return'd to the door of the Tent, and when he ſaw the Prince come out, this Animal leapt for joy, faun'd upon him and followed him. At laſt the Prince, in ſtead of being offended, eſteem'd this kindneſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of acceptance, and made much of him, giving a charge to one of his Servants to take care of him; and afterwards permitted him to come always into his Chamber, and lie at his Beds-feet. However, we ought to take great heed not to become importunate by our addreſſes; the higheſt point of wiſdome is to nick the time. But above all, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is well in the favour of his Maſter, ought never to pretend to underſtand thoſe Affairs which the Prince would keep private. There
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58553:20"/>is nothing which ſo ſoon creates ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of him, and conſequently his ruine. No man can endure that any one ſhould pry into his ſecrets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent. Confidence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with conſtraint. Foraſmuch as our Soul is born free, and ſeeing ſhe has nothing but the diſpoſing of our Will, which is really hers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of all other Power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſhe is jealous of her ſecrets, and muſt not be forced to reveal them by the indiſcretion of our Friends.

It miſſed but narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that a Prince of our time had not cauſed a Perſon of Quality to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58553:22"/>be thrown out of the Windows or his Palace. The Order which he had given to his Servants had been put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if a friend of this unhappy Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim, ſeeing him enter into the Court, had not ran to him, and prevented him from going up into the Salle, where they expected him. Thoſe who have had experience of this Paſſion, know with what tyranny it domineers over the heart of a Lover. It is a fury which ſuffers no other thoughts but thoſe of revenge to remain in the minds of ſuch as it poſſeſſes; and foraſmuch as it is not ſubject to Counſel or Reaſon, we ought to fear and avoid all the occaſions which may create it. But if the Courtier be not complaiſant to this Miſtris,
<note place="margin">

Theſe two dangers may be avoided by a little diſcretion, eſpecially if we will not voluntarily thruſt our fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into the fire; he may ſhow her that deference and civility, that ſeem affectionated to her intereſts, without ever really engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58553:22"/>therein; and he ought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her on no other ſubject, but the Paſſion and Grandeur of her Lover. If it happens that the Prince ſhould ſpeak to him concerning it, he ought to praiſe his Miſtris with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ſuch terms as may a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flatter his Love, but not give him cauſe to ſuſpect that he is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd on her.

The Princes favour is the only prop of his Felicity; but who can think himſelf

The Pleaſures and Wiſhes of our Infancy have no reſemblance with thoſe of our Youth; thoſe of our Youth are very different from thoſe of our middle Age, and theſe laſt from thoſe of our old Age. There is no minde ſo regulated, that does not ſometime change its conduct: And thoſe who obſerve exactly their temperament, muſt acknowledge that they do not finde themſelves of the ſame humour after dinner as before. <hi>Alexander</hi> loved intirely his Favourite <hi>Clytus;</hi> yet when he had drank to exceſs, he kill'd him with his own hand.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58553:24"/>to overthrow this huge Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which he looks upon as the work of his own hands. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations and vapours of Wine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to the brain, are of force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to confound all the Species of imagination, and make him abhor that which he lov'd before. What I aſſert proceeds from the Univerſal cauſe of our Nature, which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher terms the Principle of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſt. Pleaſures themſelves are no pleaſures, but becauſe of their variety, they change and ſucceed one another. <hi>Chiron</hi> was weary of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God of the Poets, becauſe all their Sacrifices were of the ſame kinde: And <hi>Polycrates</hi> complain'd that he had been too long happy. Thoſe who are ſubject to violent Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, do not remain long of the ſame minde; commonly they are as eaſily inclin'd to hate as to love. Time blots out of our memory the Idea's which our Senſes had preſented for the forming our Ratiocination and Paſſions, and there is no friendſhip ſo dear, that a long habit will not at laſt render importunate: It is

We do not perceive that we ſatisfie our own natural Levity, much more than our Friend: It is ſufficient for us to do every thing that may be advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his Intereſt; foraſmuch as thereby we run a great Riſque of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repaid with ingratitude, without expoſing our ſelves further to his falſhood.

               <p>This manner of living ſeems to me the more reaſonable, foraſmuch as it ſecures our Intereſt, without prejudicing that of our Friends.

Theſe are tokens of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which we muſt not deny them, ſince we have eſteem'd them worthy of our friendſhip: Theſe in divers

               <p>True Friendſhip has more noble and diſintereſs'd foundations: if it be perfect, it relies only upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity.

This Vice is a ſhadow which commonly follows Vertue; it ordinarily wiſhes more hurt than it does: and he who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains it, is the worſt treated by it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other Enemies are much more to be feared, of which there are two ſorts; open and hidden.</p>
               <p>The firſt we ought to repulſe with generoſity, they having no more priviledge to attack us, than we to defend our ſelves. The Precepts which incline us to be patient, have not bound our hands to let our ſelves be inſulted on: Nature teaches us to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58553:30"/>defend our lives, and Reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our honour. I eſteem this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime worthy of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Gallantry; Neither to give an affront,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nec inferre, nec perpeti.</hi> Sueton.</note> nor take one. A man of Courage has no need of Rules in this caſe, he is only to conſult his reſentment to do his duty: if he loves his Honour, he will never ſuffer it to be hurt without ſatisfaction; 'tis a place that is very tender among Perſons of Quality: if it be once wounded, it is no eaſie matter to heal it again: To be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one weakneſs is ſufficient to looſe it, and a hundred worthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can hardly regain it. Without doubt there can be no-body more miſerable than a Courtier who has committed an ignoble act: If any one ſhould chance to be ſo unhappy, I would adviſe him to hide his Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe under a Gown or a Surplice. Valour is a Virtue ſo abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for a Gentleman, that without it he cannot boaſt of any good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the way to ſerve himſelf of it advantageouſly, is never to make uſe of any artifice in Quarrels; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf ſo gallantly, that his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58553:30"/>Commence may not reproach him of having been poſſeſt with a fear of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging; not to be too curious in the choice of Weapons, and to be fully perſwaded that it is not enough to be valiant in appearance, but to be ſo in reality:

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58553:31"/>of ſubtle Policie; and foraſmuch as they attack us after a ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we muſt uſe an extraordinary diligence to defend our ſelves. Their Weapons are Artifice and treachery: Theſe are the two Serpents lying perdu under the flowers; the main point is to diſcover them for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them; but as it is a difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſcern them, they are ſo much the more to be feared.

               <p>Without diſſembling, it is no eaſie matter to diſtinguiſh them: there is nothing comes ſo neer a good Friend, as an officious flatterer; the one and the other take the ſame courſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our favour, and differ not but in their intentions: Both make us Compliments, offer us their Services, and aſſure us of their Fidelity; and we cannot diſcern them before we
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58553:32"/>bring them to the touch, as good Gold from bad: But we are ſenſible of it too late, if we wait until they declare themſelves againſt us by a treacherous action: Our Prudence ought to prevent that, by a timely diſcovery; the beſt means to do which, is to examine the Conduct of thoſe who court us,

It is good to give them Compliment for Compliment, and by a cunning and ingenious Diſſimulation aſſure them into the Snares they have ſet for us. The Italians adviſe us, if we ſhould ſee our Enemy in the water up to the middle, to help him out, ſeeing he is in a condition of ſaving himſelf without our aſſiſtance; but if he ſhould be up to the chin, to ſet our foot upon his head and drown him. It is very hard to be always masked; the Hatred of our Enemies exhales perpetually ſome ſmoak, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

The property of our Nature is, not to run into extreams without paſſing through the Mediums. The uncertainty of our Judgment keeps us always floating betwixt Hope and Fear.

Our Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does not render them leſs wicked; nor our good deeds make them more juſt to us. Their hatred and their malice are impediments, which we are obliged to remove, or renounce all our pretences to <hi>Fortune</hi> and an eſtabliſhment. As our Religion does not permit us to hate them, ſo it does not expoſe us to their fury: if they do us an injury, they tranſgreſs; and if we repulſe it without malice, we do a juſt action. But men may tell me, we ought not to be Judge and Party in our own Concerns: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it; but it does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hold good, for there are ſome wicked Actions which are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the rigour of the Laws. Thoſe of our hidden Enemies are of this number, and I conceive them to be ſo much the more dangerous, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58553:34"/>they are conceal'd, and their effects the more to be fear'd, the leſs they are manifeſt. So that in this Caſe where ſhall we demand Juſtice? and what accuſation ſhall we frame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe real Crimes which we cannot prove? My Enemy will ſpread falſe reports againſt me; he will ſurprize the underſtanding of my Maſter by his artifice; he will deſtroy all the eſteem he has for me; he will never viſit me but as a Spy; he will kiſs my hand which he would cut off, and will not embrace me but to ſuffocate me more ſecurely: His evil intentions are covered with a vail, which hides them from the ſight of all people. But if at laſt I perceive his guile,

The final Cauſe of our Actions is that which determines them; that is, which renders them good or evil: and we judge it to be ſo much the more puniſhable, as its effects are perillous. For example, if my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58553:34"/>ſhould take my Purſe, or drive me out of my Houſe, all the World will agree that he ought to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiz'd, and give me ſatisfaction for my damage: And if at Court by his wiles he ſteals from me the good will of the Prince whom I ſerve, he deprives me of all the advantages of his favour, which are of greater value to me than my Purſe or my Houſe. If he excited only by the capriciouſneſs of his bad humour, attacks my Repute, will it not be lawful for me to do my ſelf that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which I can demand of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe? My Religion prohibits me to hate my Neighbour, but it permits me to love my proper Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which I cannot maintain but by repulſing ſuch as oppoſe it. I may therefore conclude that I ought to defend my ſelf, and may be Judge in my own Cauſe. My duty as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is, not to act out of a principle of hatred; and never to procure miſchief to any perſon, if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains any other way of preventing that which he has prepared for me. The Holy Scripture blames not

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> That we ought to have private Friends, and how we ſhould beware of men in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</head>
               <p>THe principal Effort which the addreſs of a Courtier ought to make, is to render himſelf Maſter of the Prince's ear, and to get faithful friends, that may truely inform him of all that is ſpoken againſt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his abſence. As it is very dangerous to have ſecret Enemies, ſo it is very uſeful to have private and unknown Friends: Men are not ſo reſerved in ſpeaking before them; they will with greater facility pump out the Secrets of others: By the liberty they take of cenſuring the Favourite, they will diſcover every one's inclinations, by which means the Favourite may take juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of what he ought to practice or avoid. This kinde of Friendſhip is ſeldom found among thoſe of any great Rank at Court; for to ſpeak
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58553:36"/>truely they very much reſemble ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Spies: 'Tis oftener met withal among private perſons, who have more Wit than <hi>Fortune;</hi> and men muſt be bountiful, and open their purſes to this ſort of people; for experience teaches us, that no money is ſo advantageouſly employ'd, as when they chuſe diſcreetly on whom to beſtow it. This Age has ſeen a grand Miniſter admired by all, a moſt exact obſerver of this Maxime, which ever ſucceeded well to him. Deſignes of importance are like to Mines, which become ineffectual when once diſcovered.</p>
               <p>But if a Courtier judges that the Cabal and Intrigues of his Enemies are too difficult to ſuſtain, and that he miſtruſts his own addreſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting them, I do not diſapprove his pulling off the masks from their faces, and declaring himſelf openly their Enemy. By this means he deſtroys or at leaſt diminiſhes the Faith which the Prince might otherwiſe give to their impoſture: and after this he hearkens to them but as intereſſed parties, who carry rather Revenge in their hearts, than Truth in their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58553:36"/>mouths. Moreover, the Courtier ſhows that he does not fear them by taking the liberty to decry them at Court, and make their Malice appear before the World, by which he alſo juſtifies and confirms his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the Opinion of his Maſter. This proceeding is always advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, when manag'd with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and for my part, I had rather follow it, and run the hazard of what may happen, than to perplex my minde with ſo many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpections, which cannot but be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to a Man of Courage: for I eſteem it more glorious to wage War as a Lion, than as a Fox. I look upon a Courtier to be in a great perplexity, that reckons Prieſts and Women among his ſecret Friends: This laſt remedy is nor convenient for him, and ſuch a Gallantry of ſpirit is unſeaſonable. Theſe are indeed a ſort of flies, which although not of great force, are very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning. Princes Cabiners are filled with them; and I hold him a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and diſcreet man, who can win them to his party: in order to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58553:37"/>which, it is requiſite to uſe complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, ſweetneſs, and ſometimes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This has no need of farther illuſtration, there being few who have not had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hereof: the beſt precaution is, to be reſerved in our diſcourſe, to have a probity not fictitious or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, to perſwade our ſelves ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is more advantageous to be an honeſt man in reality than in appearance.

Thus we ſee, that contempt does not leſs torment us than our tranſgreſſions. From hence I conclude, that it is more ſecure and

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58553:38"/>more to do, but to follow it to arrive at Happineſs; for as it aſſures us of the rewards of the other Life, it ſhows us the way to deſerve them. If we take it rightly, Devotion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing contrary to Gentility, but it muſt be practis'd with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as all other things ſhould be. The habit of a Capuchin would not fit well on a Courtier. Our Piety ought to be real and unfeigned, and herein conſiſts the higheſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: when we do not adjuſt it to our Profeſſion, it becomes indiſcreet. We may lawfully carry the Chalice with rich and embroydred habits: for to be chaſt and continent, it is not requiſite to ſhun the Societie of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Quality; their approbation contributes often to our good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and I conceive it neceſſary for an Accompliſht perſon to enjoy their Converſation; 'tis from them we learn a good Deportment; they inſpire into us a deſire of rendering our ſelves complaiſant to all people, and by conſequence guide us in the path to Vertue.

One that is thus ſuperſtitiouſly ſcrupulous, ought to quit his pretenſions to a Fortune: It is a duty incumbent on him, either to conform himſelf to the Manners of the Court, or not to come at it.

To be a good Religious man of any Order, it is neceſſary to obſerve exactly its Rule and Contututions; and to be a good Courtier, the ſame conſequence teaches us to live after the mode of the Court. As all Profeſſions have their different ends, ſo likewiſe there
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58553:39"/>are divers ways to arrive at them; what is advantageous in the one, is often prejudicial in the other. An Officer of an Army would be very ill obey'd, if he ſhould command his his Souldiers in the ſame tone that a Fanatick ſays his Prayers. Would not alſo a man in holy Orders be thought as ridiculous to entertain a Lady with gallantry; as a Courtier, if he ſhould attempt to make exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to her? We have occaſion of making uſe of our judgement in all the actions of this life: Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may have its exceſs, as well as other things. Vertue is never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and undetermin'd; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect, it derives its Rules from Mediocrity, and to take it rightly, it is Mediocrity it ſelf.

               <p>THis default, although very common, ſeems more in uſe among Men of the Sword, than of any other Profeſſion. I know not whether it is from Cuſtom or Neceſſity, that we allow them more liberty than others: For my part, I do not diſapprove of a Young man's ſhowing himſelf ſomewhat brisk, provided he be not arrogant and imperious. The Wiſdome, which does every thing by compaſs, which affects a cenſorious Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which has always a frowning brow, and which ſpeaks not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58553:41"/>but in monoſillables, like <hi>Kablais</hi>'s Gray Fryar, is not in my Opinion that which becomes a man of the Court. This wiſdom, I ſay, ought not to have ſo much left her as her nails, wherewith ſhe might ſcratch and offend her Friends; but ſhould always appear both agreeable and debonaire, and above all, ſuitable to the years of him, who poſſeſſes her: For that of young perſons admits of nothing ſevere, receives complaiſance into the number of Vertues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects neither decency nor any other thing which contributes to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a good meen: Comlineſs has great Charms to bewitch hearts; we can hardly forbear having an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for one that enters into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a good grace. His Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and his Countenance convince us of his Merit, and the freedom which appears in his actions, that he is a perſon of Quality. To know how to dreſs himſelf advantageouſly, is not an unprofitable ſcience. A Courtier of our time ſaid, that a Gentleman was fine enough when he was black, new, and neat: And
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58553:41"/>indeed it is not always the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, which denotes a Gentleman; undoubtedly it has a great luſtre, but it is uneaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to make it continue. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are always followed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: it is better that one ſhould make himſelf ordinary Clothes often, than rich, and wear them a long time. Moreover, his chief care ought to be, not to affect ſtrange faſhions, or any out of the mode. The fantaſtickneſs of his habit, gives men cauſe to ſuſpect that of his Manners. If he is proper in his own perſon, he will be ſo in his equipage and retinue. 'Tis his duty to conſult his purſe, for to increaſe or diminiſh it; and I would adviſe him rather to get many Merits, than a quantity of Servants: the great train of Pages and Footmen, which paſs not the Court of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> make no great noiſe in the Preſence-chamber; it becomes only the Lords of Low <hi>Britain,</hi> who come once or twice in their lives to ſhow their Noſes at Court, to be accompani'd like the Embaſſadors of the great Mogol: Theſe are but wiles to amuſe Citizens
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58553:42"/>and Country-men. He ought to wear ſuch a garb as he can maintain a long time, and which may ſecure him from the diſgrace of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bayliffs clutches. Profuſeneſs goes never without Injuſtice and Folly: It is not the property of a diſcreet man to contract Debts, and not to be in a condition to pay them: If he be of this humour, he will finde much to do to ſave his Repute, and not paſs for a Cheat. What I ſpeak concerning the Equipage, is alſo to be underſtood of the Table; if he concerns himſelf therewith, he is oblig'd to keep a good one. This is a way to extend his acquaintance, but no ſure one to procure friends: The greateſt part of thoſe who dine with us, come not to oblige us; it is very much if they forbear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trowling the Sawces and the Drink. When one keeps open houſe, the whole Court think they have right to ſit down at his Table: This Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limaufry of men would make me ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor this kinde of Expence, which deprives him of his liberty that makes it.

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58553:42"/>at <hi>Paris,</hi> who thought to gain great Credit by this means; but they reapt no other benefit by their expences, than to be called <hi>Martyn</hi> the eater, <hi>Martyn</hi> that's eaten, and <hi>Martyn</hi> whom men eat: For my part, I look upon the firſt as the moſt prudent. The pleaſure of good Chear ceaſes to be a pleaſure, ſo ſoon as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd. I would very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of making good Meals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they were not Ordinaries, free to all Comers. 'Tis enough that a Courtier reſignes to his Maſter all his liberty; it is too pretious a Jewel to be proſtrated before the multitude; he ought to husband it as well as his Purſe. The Farmers of the Crowns Revenues may treat at their Tables private perſons out of that which they extort from the Publick; and 'tis wiſdom to make themſelves conſidered for thoſe things which they poſſeſs of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt value: 'Tis ſufficient for them that men admire their Cooks and their Plate; for we ſhould not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them by endeavouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our ſelves of their qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58553:43"/>and ſhould be hardly put to't to praiſe their worth. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which I give to a young Courtier, would not be proper for a Miniſter of State, or a great Lord, whoſe Fortunes are already well advanced: To theſe, a Table is a mark of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, which is not unprofitable, for it facilitates the acceſs to their perſons, and gives their friends, who court them, an opportunity of receiving their careſſes; and ſeeing they are ſuperiour to their Gueſts, they cannot be much importun'd by them. It behoves a Courtier to know and to conſider, that as there is a great difference between him that ſeeks his fortune, and him that has made it; ſo their manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ought not to be alike. What we do without diſcretion, cannot be well done: Deprive a man of this guide, and you take away the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Veſſel.</p>

But theſe are not ſubjects fit to make a Fortune, they want Counſel onely to keep them from committing groſs abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in their Country: Civility, Generoſity, and Liberality, are to be Inculcated into them.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> That Marriage contributes to our Fortune: And whether a Nobleman ought to prefer a Princeſs before a Lady of his own quality.</head>
               <p>IT ſeems to me not to be ſufficient for a Perſon of Quality who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to raiſe his Family, to think onely upon the favour of his Maſter, and forget all other means that may contribute to his Fortune. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that his allying himſelf is not to be lightly eſteemed, if he conſiders of what importance it is to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment. The <hi>Germans</hi> want no advice in this point, the Laws of their Country forbidding them to miſ-ally themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That in caſe a Count of the Empire ſhould eſpouſe a Wife beneath his quality, His Children muſt loſe their Rank and Dignity. Our <hi>France</hi> has dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Cuſtomes, which perhaps are not better; but as I am no Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them, it ſhall ſuffice me to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58553:46"/>draw from thence ſome profitable Obſervations. In Marriages there are three eſſential things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; the Birth, the Perſon, and the Wealth.</p>
               <p>I put the Birth in the firſt place, becauſe it is of marvelous weight, and gives me occaſion to treat of a queſtion which perhaps has never yet been debated, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a Great Lord who may pretend to the Marriage of a Princeſs, ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer her before a Lady of his own qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? This Probleme has at firſt ſight ſuch a luſtre that dazles our Eyes; and without controverſie prevails over our opinion; we ſhall meet but with very few, who do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be too evident to be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: they will ſay, that the Children of a Princeſs, although no Princes, have yet ſomewhat more than other Gentlemen; that their Birth, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them related to thoſe Grandees whom the World adores, demands ſome reſpect from the Nobility, and makes them partakers of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: That Princes conſidering them as their own Blood, are obliged to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58553:46"/>promote their Intereſts at Court and in the Country, and to procure them the greateſt Charges and the chief ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the State; that even if they ſhould want Natural qulifications, yet Princes would be engaged to do as much for them, by the care they have of upholding their own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Men may adde many other fine Flouriſhes to adorn this ſide of the Medail; but what would appear if we ſhould turn it, ſeeing all things are Problematical? And if they ſhould anſwer, that a Princeſs being not able to make a Prince, ſhe is not able to make a great Lord, it being true he ſhould be ſuch by the onely Quality of his Father; that his Merit joyn'd to his Birth, will make him to be reſpected by the Nobility without the addition of a Principality, is onely an errour; as alſo to believe that Princes as being his Relations do eſpouſe his Intereſt: For on the contrary, as being above him, they look upon him as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the honour of their alliance, if he be not inſeparably grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Fortune and Grandeur: that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58553:47"/>their Credit is not an infallible way for to obtain the greateſt Employs; the Court having this Policy, that diſſwades her from beſtowing ſuch extraordinary favours by the hands of Princes, foraſmuch as ſhe makes them more Creatures, which ſhe raiſes up againſt her own Intereſt: She knows, that they will receive to themſelves all the acknowledgements and gratitude of thoſe, for whom they have procured theſe Honours: And that to gratifie them after this manner, is to foment their Ambition, and fortifie their Party: Therefore there muſt be always ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Violence to ſnatch out of her hands favours of ſuch Importance. They may alſo add, that the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not to oblige any but her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; &amp; we ſeldom ſee that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces poſſeſs this Station in the hearts of Kings: for if they look upon them as their Relations, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily rid themſelves of the thoughts, that they may one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt; and ſo cannot ſuffer their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without ſome reluctancie and diſquiet. All theſe conſiderations
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58553:47"/>have made many conclude, that ſuch alliances are more inconvenient than advantageous for thoſe who apply themſelves directly to the ſervice and perſon of our Kings;

The great Miniſters will always ſuſpect him, and will never be perſwaded that he can diſingage him from it fairly, and with ſafety. And indeed, with what eye can a great Lord behold the ruine of a Prince his neer Relation, without centributing to uphold his Fortune when it totters? And how can he believe that he ſhall not be cruſht un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Ruines, if the unhappineſs of his affairs is ſuch, that it does fall? Does he think that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for ſaving himſelf will have a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58553:48"/>good opinion of him? And if he be wanting to his Relations in an urgent neceſſity, how can they rely upon his generoſity? Or what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can they have to put any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſervices of one, who could forget his Extraction, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his private Intereſt, before the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Civility, of Nature, and of Bloud? There are no Rules ſo general, but what admit of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: Loyalty is neceſſary, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it; but Generoſity is not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; and we know it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but in difficult times, and on perillous occaſions. I ſay, moreover, it is ſo much the more to be eſteem'd in our Enemies, as it is more remote from the ordinary ſentiments of baſe and vulgar Souls; who have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object, but their Intereſt, and who act nothing by the impulſe of Vertue alone. Theſe are like to <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop</hi>'s Dog; they expect to receive the recompenſes which are figured at that time in the Court, which are but ſhadows and ſmoak: ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes every thing, to diſ-unite thoſe that moleſt her; but no man is in a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58553:48"/>condition of forcing her to keep her word: Her negotiations ſeldom fail of ſucceſs; her end is to ſeparate friendſhips, to put a diffidence into the parties, and even to produce ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred among Relations, when ſhe meets with inconſtant and irreſolute minds. For my part, I conceive that we ought to reſolve betimes, either to reſigne up our ſelves abſolutely to the Court, making it a Caſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and our Duty; it being true, that the Allegiance we owe to the King, renders his Part the moſt juſt; or to follow the fortune of the Prince, to whom we are related, let what will happen. Things were never ſo long time calm among us, that we are not forc'd ſometimes to diſcover our ſelves, and to conceal our ſelves again in our Burrows like Foxes.

               <p>But to Anſwer to theſe Reaſons; is there any thing more Tyrannical, than to ſhare all the moments of our Life, all our Troubles, and all our Pleaſures, with a perſon, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and even indifferent to us? If it be true that Enjoyment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes Love, might we not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that the ſame Enjoyment will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58553:50"/>change our indifference into hatred; and this laſt Paſſion will precipitate us into a gulf of Griefs and Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? That having eſpouſed one, without having before ſeen her but with the eyes of another, ſhe will not appear to us agreeable; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not known her but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our Parents, we abandon our ſelves as hond-winkt to her croſs humours, and perhaps to ſemething worſe. To be dealt withal after this manner, is to be carri'd to a Priſon, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> loads us with Chains, from which we can never be releas'd, but by Death.</p>
               <p>It is not reaſonable that our Will, ſo neceſſary in Matrimony, ſhould be forced by the choice and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Parents; ſeeing it is ſo free by Nature, that the moſt cruel Tyrants in the World have not the power to violate its freedom. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that a fair Lady ſhould in a ſhort time looſe her Charms, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very homely Woman; we are well aſſured that a homely Lady will never grow handſom after ſhe is marri'd; and her malice will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſe than diminiſh. But

As they are of greater force, they act with greater impetuoſity upon the minde of a young man, ſo that he frequently purſues that which he loves, and embraces that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Preſumption is a malady which muſt of neceſſity be healed; it is ſo much an Enemy to deference and Counſel, that it cannot be reconcil'd with Wiſdom: yet it is not requiſite that he deveſts himſelf altogether of the good opinion he has of himſelf; that is another extreme which would produce as dangerous conſequences. Humility does not oblige a man of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to think himſelf a Coward, nor a Doctor to believe himſelf Illiterate, nor a Courtier to perſwade himſelf that he underſtands not to live among the better ſort: It is enough if we are as ſevere Judges of our own vices &amp; defaults as we would be of others.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58553:53"/>We may examine our ſelves in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as well without ſhame, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſſes. Let us keep our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſilent, while Reaſon informs us what we are, and what we are worth, and we ſhall never fail of knowing our ſelves. If theſe Reflections could but enter into the minds of Young men; if they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their own Reaſon, yet they would more adhere to that of their Friends, which is ever the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; acting with greater freedom, and leſs intereſt. Humane Prudence has not found out better precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt theſe Accidents. I have formerly ſaid, that ſhe has her Bounds, and her natural weakneſs; and performs her duty, when ſhe does what ſhe is able. Providence accompliſhes the remainder accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her pleaſure;

A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and reſolved man expects with patience, the arrival of that which ſhe has determin'd of his Fortune:
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58553:53"/>if he be turn'd out of the Court, he ſuffers it without regret, and does not eſteem himſelf unhappy when he is retired to his own houſe.

This change which diminiſhes his hopes, encreaſes his Repoſe: And from the time he forſook the Empire of Fortune, he findes himſelf in the arms of Philoſophy. His Conduct which does not reproach him for his faults, comforts him in his bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58553:54"/>after this manner, if he be a great Lord in his Province:

Poverty is an evil that puts the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant out of his play, and diſarms him. The Precepts of Philoſophy concerning the contempt of things that periſh, are no currant money, with which we can pay our debts: That which gives me a bad opinion of them, is, that their Authors never were reduc'd to any extremity or want. They have furniſht us with Weapons, of which they never made any uſe; they have vanquiſht an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, who was not in a capacity to do them any hurt: And I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be induc'd to believe that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> took as great pleaſure in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Scholars, as in reigning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> It is hard to tumble down from a ſteep place without
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58553:54"/>bruiſing our ſelves; there is nothing but Wealth that can ſave us, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our ſpirits in great extremities. 'Tis that, which exempts us from the inſupportable inconveniencies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Poverty precipitates us; and 'tis that alone, which can defend us againſt the contempt of our Equals, and the pity of our Inferiors. The greateſt Worth in the world buried under indigence, is a Mine of Gold which no man has diſcovered: thoſe who poſſeſs it, are not more at their eaſe; and thoſe who know it not, trample it under their feet, without informing themſelves of its value. The Cruelty of the Emperour <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> had not reduced <hi>Belliſarius</hi> to the laſt extremity, if after having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of the honour of ſo many Battels, he had not forc'd him to beg an Alms at the ſame Gate of <hi>Rome,</hi> through which he had entred ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Triumph with Captive Kings bound to his Chariot. And that Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> had not more cauſe to lament, for the loſs of his States and Dignity, than to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neceſſitated to cut faggots in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58553:55"/>Foreſt of <hi>Swaben</hi> for the ſuſtenance of his wretched life. I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the Spirit of a wiſe man is not dejected nor debaſed, when he obtains not thoſe Honours which he deſerved by his ſervices: I know that he bears it out gallantly, when he is deprived thereof unjuſtly; but I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not with what rules of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy he can render his minde ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and undiſturb'd, when he ſhall endure the afflictions of an extreine Poverty. The Philoſopher would be very impertinent, that endeavours to prove, that ragged Clothes will defend me againſt Cold, and that I ought not to be troubled, when I have not whereon to dine. He may tell me, that Nature is contented with a little, I confeſs it; but it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that degree we are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: A Prince would be very poor, if he ſhould have no greater Revenue left him, than would very well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate a private Gentleman.</p>
               <p>From this reaſoning I conclude, that a Gentleman who has Wit and Wealth according to his condition, may live happily, whatſoever befals
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58553:55"/>him: That he ought to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to arrive at the great Honours of the State, either by the War, or by the Services which he ſhall render to the perſon of the Prince: If he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, he will enjoy the benefit of his labours with pleaſure; if his deſignes do not proſper, he has no cauſe to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair abſolutely, being in a condition of living privately in the ſame ſplendor his Anceſtors lived before him.

               <p>IF he puts on the Caſſock, he will meet with many things in the conduct of a Man of the Sword, which he ought not to follow: His Profeſſion obliges him to a more grave Modeſty, to a more reſerved Converſation, to a more exemplary Piety, and to more regulated Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. As the Exerciſes of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man are of no uſe to him, ſo Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is very neceſſary for him; it is a ſhameful thing for one of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be illiterate. The Sciences never appear with ſo much grace, as in the poſſeſſion of a Nobleman; they have Charms which raviſh all people, and conſtrain even the moſt inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to love thoſe who know how to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58553:56"/>ſerve themſelves advantageouſly thereof. 'Tis almoſt an infallible way of arriving at great Employs: we have ſo many examples of this kinde, that it would be very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to ſeek for them in Ages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from our own knowledge; and to underſtand it aright, is it not juſt, that thoſe who can ſee ſhould lead thoſe that are blinde? and who can deny, that Learning joyn'd to good natural parts, does not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Perſon extraordinarily? The Sciences lead him in a Path ſtrown with Roſes, to arrive at <hi>Fortune;</hi> they put a gloſs on his Worth; they give him entrance into the Councils of Kings; they teach him the Art to incline men as he pleaſes; and at laſt, they make him either a great Prelar in the Church, or a great Miniſter in the State. Oh, what a happy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is this, and how many perſons of Quality would follow it, if they knew all the benefits thereof! I mean, what I have before hinted, if they have a natural diſpoſition thereto: For indeed, it is no eaſie Enterprize, to render our ſelves lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58553:57"/>the Sciences are tedious and painful to be acquired; and to have them infuſed, we muſt be Saints. The Poets had reaſon to lodge them upon the top of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> whoſe exceſſive height made the acceſs very difficult. The <hi>Muſes</hi> who preſided there, took delight in being courted, and it was a great advantage to be in their favour: It belongs to them only to give a ſatisfaction to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and a reſurrection to the Dead. We ſhould have had no knowledge of <hi>Alexander,</hi> if Hiſtory had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him; and all the brave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> and of <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> had been buried in an Eternal Oblivion, if they themſelves had not written them. Vertue it ſelf, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable as it is, cannot be without them, ſeeing her true Recompenſe is Glory and Immortality. On whom do you think future Ages will beſtow greateſt Encomiums, either on Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> or on the Captains who fought in his time? His Head gave motion to their hands; if they have had good Succeſs, the Glory thereof is due to him; he was the Cauſe,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58553:57"/>and they the Inſtruments; and we may ſay, that their Valour could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear without contributing to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of him that directed them. The Orders which he gave at eaſe in his Cabinet, made all <hi>Europe</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: his Prudence prevented the bad accidents; his Reaſon penetrated the moſt obſcure things; his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was without errour; and his Conduct has appear'd ſo good, that we cannot ſpeak of the Grandeur of the King, without praiſing his Worth and Vertue.</p>
               <p>It is very rare, that a perſon of Quality, of extraordinary Worth, does not make a great Fortune: His Sufficiencie impoſes a certain neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity on the Prince to employ him, who although he has no natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, yet the Welfare of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs will urge him to it: He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives they cannot be entruſted in better hands; and by doing it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges himſelf of a multitude of cares, which make the Crown as uneaſie to him that wears it, as it appears glorious to the eyes of thoſe that adore it. But ſuppoſe he be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58553:58"/>not ſo happy as to arrive at this height, he is not out of <hi>Fortune</hi>'s way, if he be not in the leaſt concern'd in the affairs of State; it will be much more eaſie for him to obtain a good Biſhoprick, or a rich Abby, than for a Man of the Sword of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a conſiderable Government for a reward of his ſervices: yet the firſt walks in a ſmooth path, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſecure; the other in a rugged road full of perils: Both have their Fortunes for their Objects, but are not equally happy in the choice of the Ways that bring them thither. The great unhappineſs of Young men, is, that the heat of their Bloud ferments in their Veins, and renders them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being perſwaded to any thing: They fancie, that there is nothing ſo brave as the Eſteem of a man of Courage, and that they ought to parallel the noble Exploits of the <hi>Heroes</hi> in Hiſtory. They never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to themſelves any thing, but the pleaſure of ſatisfying their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, without having any reſpect to the difficulties that may occur: And if it happens that they are once
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58553:58"/>enamour'd, every thing muſt then give place to their Love, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them that the Poſſeſſion of their Miſtris is the only bleſſing, which can render them happy; they look then upon the Caſſock with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, ſeeing it oppoſes it ſelf to their deſigne. Theſe are ſick people who flye the Phyſicians, blinde who refuſe to be led, and who quit the path of Fortune to purſue that of Pleaſure. But I would willingly put the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to a diſ-intereſſed man: If they had but once learnt from the experience of their Friends, that there is but three months fruition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to deſtroy this violent Paſſion, which treats them ſo imperiouſly; if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let us finiſh this Diſcourſe with this which follows from the proofs of my firſt Propoſition; that we ought not to attribute to Fortune that which happens to us by our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence; that thoſe who penetrate into the Cauſes, eaſily diſcover their Effects: And that our ignorance and heedleſſneſs are the Sources of our Adverſity, and our Judgement and Experience of our Proſperity.</p>

Nevertheleſs to form the ſociety of a civil Life, we are forc'd to forget our proper Principle, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that of Nature.

               <p>Nobility has in all Ages been the reward of generous Exploits perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the War. It was by this means that Princes always engaged the moſt Valiant in their Service; and this juſt recompence of Honour, which was but perſonal, deſcended afterwards to their Poſterity, and became Hereditary to Infants, who through the imbecility of their age, were not capable of deſerving it. Therefore men cannot deny, but it is a great advantage to be born a Gentleman; and that Vertue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with a greater luſtre in perſons of a good Extraction: But I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there is no other reaſon for it, than a Cuſtom we have to believe it ſo. We are eaſily convinced, that our Progenitors have raiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58553:63"/>but received Cuſtoms have ſuch a Tyrannical power, that they force even our very Judgements. For to examine things very well, what has Nature done more for the Nobleman than for the Yeoman?

                  </note> and who can perceive any difference between them, when they ſuck the Breaſts of their Nurſes? If we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that they have the ſame Organs, the ſame Temperament, and the ſame Faculties of Soul and Body; where ſhall we finde that difference, that exalts the Nobleman to that degree, and depreſſes the Yeoman ſo unjuſtly? We have an infinity of Examples, which would contradict this opinion, and make us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Vertue and Merit are equally proper to all men. When the People of <hi>Rome</hi> conſtrain'd the Senate to admit the <hi>Plebëans</hi> to the dignity of the Conſulſhip as well as the <hi>Patricians,</hi> the Republick did not finde its Puiſſance leſſened, nor its Dominions limited. We do not read that thoſe <hi>Plebëan</hi> Conſals were ever more guilty of Cowardiſe, or had leſs Zeal for their Honour
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58553:63"/>than their Colleagues. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the men of Learning, the greateſt Proficients have not been Noblemen. <hi>Homer</hi>'s Birth was ſo obſcure,

When it pleaſes the King to Nobilitate a Yeoman by vertue of his abſolute power, do we obſerve that his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent encreaſes his Worth?

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58553:66"/>For to prohibit the uſe of a thing, it is neceſſary, that it muſt either be bad in it ſelf, or produce bad effects.

But if this Profeſſion be ſo much beneath Noblemen, that it is a diſgrace for them to follow it, why do they ſerve in the Armies of theſe Merchants, whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be their Maſters, and receive their Pay? Is it not a great extravagance to obey (in the <hi>Indies</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi>) thoſe as Maſters, whom we do not eſteem to be our Equals in <hi>France?</hi> Let the Laws enjoyn what they will, Commerce
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58553:68"/>is ſo neceſſary, that they cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any man from being a Merchant. The relation is ſo juſt between the Buyer and the Seller, that if you take away the one, you deſtroy the other.

And if I ſell the Corn of my fields, or the Sheep of my fold, I am a Merchant of Corn and Sheep, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that men ſo call as well ſuch as ſell, as thoſe that buy. They may tell me, that there is a neceſſity for converting the Fruits of our Lands into money, that we might purchaſe other things, which they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. I confeſs it: and is it agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baſeneſs to ſell again the Corn, which I had bought of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a good peny-worth, to gain thereby, than to put off that of my own growing to get money inſtead thereof? The Fruits ought to change their condition in the Lands of Noblemen; and Nature ſhould give them ſome prerogative above thoſe of the Yeomen, that therein might be found this difference, which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58553:68"/>is really nothing elſe but the effect of our grippleneſs. Nevertheleſs men ceaſe to be Gentlemen, when they begin to be Merchants; and our Cuſtomes are not contented with beſtowing the greateſt Wealth of the Family on the Eldeſt Sons; but after having rendred the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, poor, they even deny them the power of acquiring a ſubſiſtance, of which they have deprived them.</p>

Poverty has a certain force, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58553:69"/>depreſſes the courage of ſome, and makes others deſperate: thoſe whoſe mindes are heightned by their Birth and education, cannot condeſcend without great regret to liſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Captains, who are not ſo good as themſelves. This way of raiſing their Fortune is tedious, painful and uncertain, but neceſſary to thoſe who have never ſtudied, nor rendered themſelves expert at their Exerciſes. I would adviſe a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who is reduced to this point, to ſeek the favour of ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Officer of the Army, and gain him to be his Patron; this will ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the way which he is to keep, to arrive at Military Charges, without which I ſhould eſteem him very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to ſerve. Valour loves not the Crowd; it ſeeks the open Day, that it might be ſeen. I have known Souldiers, who have made attempts deſperate in the higheſt degree, which were never mentioned but in their own Company. The ſcope of a Gentleman ought not to be to gain Eſteem onely, but alſo to make his Fortune by his Sword: So that he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58553:69"/>ſhould omit nothing whereby he might obtain ſuch Charges, as may expoſe him to the ſight of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to the end that his Valour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, he might aſpire to thoſe recompences which he has deſerved. The art is to apply himſelf diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his buſineſs, to perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he may obtain the chief Employs, by paſſing through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; to learn the general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Orders; to remark carefully the Encamping and Decamping of the Army, the forms of Battle-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, the Storming of places; to be with the Engineers at their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallations, at the conſtruction of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and at the opening of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; to enter into the Mines and Counter-mines; to inſtruct himſelf of every thing concerning the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; to accompany the General Officers, when they go to take a view of the places they deſigne to attaque, or the Paſs through which the Army muſt march; to apply himſelf ſeriouſly to the ſtudy of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry and Fortification, joyning the Theory with the Practice: and

               <p>IF the Peace be ſo univerſal, that he cannot get any Military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy; and if the neceſſity of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or his Paſſion of advancing his Fortune, cauſes him to abandon his home, and get himſelf a Service; it is not to be doubted but his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58553:72"/>will depend from the choice which he ſhall make of a Maſter. To attend on a Lord, who is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of advancing our Fortune, is the ſame as to embark our ſelves in a leaky Veſſel. And to diſcern this, we muſt endeavour to underſtand his Intereſt and Abilities: for I may aſſert, that if he be deſtitute of an Employment, and has no good parts, he is not proper to render a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happy. We reaſon idly and ſottiſhly, to perſwade our ſelves, that he being rich, will recompenſe us: Never any Ingenious man built his Fortune upon the Purſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. If he be a Great Lord, his Quality obliges him to great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and conſequently puts him in a very bad condition of making ſuch conſiderable Preſents as may enrich a Gentleman; and if he be not rich, we can expect no benefit in his ſervice. Liberality is a Saint, which has no Altars in the World; and the greateſt part of Noblemen have leſs knowledge of her, than private Gentlemen. The Reſpect which is given them from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58553:72"/>perſwades them, that every thing is created for them; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſervices as deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One can hardly diſtinguiſh them in this poſture from <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> and they are ſometimes abus'd like <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains.</hi> It is very hard for a poor Gentleman to undergo all theſe

Subjection is an evil which draws on a thouſand others after it; and therefore I do not admire, that it ſhould be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Worth and Vertue. The <hi>Romans</hi> fought Six hundred years to win their liberty; and the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> have hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all to regain theirs. I eſteem it the Soveraign good of this life, when Fortune ſuffers us to enjoy it without want or ambition.

'Tis through this fair gate we ſhould make our entry into Great Families; and 'tis in this that our Friends can render us good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they make a beautiful draught of our Extraction, and Qualifications.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58553:74"/>where we would ſettle our ſelves. Among the Nobility, there are ever ſome wiſe, and more ingenious than others. Among the Clergy, ſome more learned, who pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the reſt. And in Cities, are Officers of good repute and credit; when once we are known to them, and they have thought us worthy of their approbation, without doubt they will give a good Character of us to ſuch as know us not. Their Teſtimonies and Reports will make us paſs for what we are, and in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time will extend our Reputation through the whole Province. The Multitude,

                  </note> which examines nothing, conſents preſently to thoſe who have the greateſt Vogue among them: and ſeeing our Eſteem is formed by the number, and we have no other opportunity of manifeſting our Parts in publick; Prudence commands us to make uſe of theſe Trumpets, to ſpread abroad our good Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus the minds of men being poſſeſt with a great opinion of our Worth, a Great Lord, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his own Intereſts, believes
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58553:74"/>himſelf as much obliged to entertain us, as we are to ſerve him. Another Reaſon is, that every one conſiders himſelf in the firſt place, and that both Glory and Profit will redound to him by being attended by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious perſon; and eſpecially if he has great Employments, foraſmuch as being obliged to give out many Commiſſions, which depend on his Miniſtry, he takes pleaſure to entruſt them with underſtanding perſons, who can give a good account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſo that there happens a certain connexion between the Maſter and Servant, which frequently produces Friendſhip in the one, and Profit for the other. If we acquit our ſelves worthily of an ordinary Employ, they are eaſily enclin'd to beſtow a better upon us. Employments are linkt one to another; our Sufficiencie and Conduct turn the Wheel, which raiſes them in our favour, and we become rich without impoveriſhing our Maſters. Their ſervices reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Flambo's, which give light to many, without diminiſhing any thing of their heat or brightneſs. Our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58553:75"/>Fidelity and Affection joyn'd to the acknowledgement of the favours which they have procured us, make them rejoyce at our proſperity; they look upon it as one of their faireſt Productions, without deſiſting from giving us ſome means of encreaſing it; foraſmuch as it contributes to their Glory, without putting them to any expence or charge. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches us, that there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon abſolutely diſ-intereſted; and the moſt generous are never to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to do good out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Vertue alone. Thus Wiſe men for the obtaining of a Courteſie, finde out ſome way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs their Benefactors in their own concern. The very Country-men who follow the light of Nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, perceiving themſelves equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Abilities and Merits, have their recourſe to preſents,

               <p>THere are ſome popular errours, which have gained ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the number of thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, that the wiſeſt men finde it very difficult to unwinde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of them. If a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon conſults his Friends about the choice of a Maſter, they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him that an ingenious perſon (as I ſuppoſe he is) would be happy to get into the ſervice of a Prince or a great Lord, very rich, and of little Wit; that he would infallibly poſeſs himſelf of his Inclinations; that he would become Maſter of his affairs, as alſo of his Conduct; that the whole houſe would have dependance on him; that he would have the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of his Wealth, and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that at laſt he ſhould want onely the Name and the Arms of his Maſter, to entitle himſelf the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

               <p>There is nothing ſo oppoſite to a man of underſtanding as an ignorant perſon, and conſequently more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtant: the property of a ſoft man, is to caſhire, or to fear one that is more ingenious than himſelf.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58553:77"/>him, not perſwade him; his Merit becomes a burthen to him, and his Eſteem diſpleaſes him; he imagines that men attribute to his attendant the good ſucceſs of his affairs; and ſo will make him reſponſible for the events of his Counſels; but if they have happy ends, he willingly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes them to himſelf; if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, he lays the whole fault on the other's ill conduct. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy is too troubleſome for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof; and I conceive, that to be able to continue himſelf therein, is to have attained the greateſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of humane prudence: For if by his addreſs he cauſes his Maſter to eſcape ſome dangerous paſſage, he muſt not expect to have any thanks therefore; becauſe his Maſter is Blinde, and neither comprehends the excellency of any Counſels, not diſcerns of what importance the Services are, that are rendred him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> there can be nothing more difficult than to take right meaſures with him: the moſt Illuminated Wits are forc'd here to grope out their way, &amp; all their addreſs cannot ſecure them from falling into disfavour.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:58553:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>To believe, that he may hope for any conſiderable advantage, when even he has acquired all the credit with his Maſter he wiſht for, is an errour which ought to be rejected, as very prejudicial. Men of little ſenſe are not capable of great Vertues. It belongs not to feeble and Vulgar Souls to make efforts, which may elevate them above other men. The Vertues are habits of the Soul, by the which our intellect is rendred fit to conceive well, and to act well; and he who has no Wit, being not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of reaſoning well, is ſo much the leſs of doing well. If this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is falſe, we muſt neceſſarily overthrow the principles of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if it is true, what ought we to expect from a man that cannot be liberal, ſeeing that Liberality is a Vertue, the acquifition whereof ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the power of his Wit? and it is ſo much the more out of his reach, as it is contrary to the Sentiments of the multitude, whoſe moſt fervent Paſſion is to poſſeſs Wealth, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to part with it: and indeed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is the effort of a Soul, who
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58553:78"/>has in it the ſparks of all other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. It is ſo noble, that it ſeems to have been made for <hi>Heroes</hi> alone: She preſides as a Queen among Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Spirits; ſhe keeps in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, Juſtice and Generoſity; and Prudence marches before her, to give her light, and to conduct her. When men know her Origine, they do not admire that ſhe abhors common Souls: to give without Judgement, is not Liberality; we muſt know how to diſcern the worth of thoſe on whom it is exercis'd. This Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is the Siſter of Charity; the one rewards the Merit of the Vertuous, the other comforts the Miſery of the Afflicted.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, when an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon falls into the hands of a wiſe and underſtanding Prince, he can never want ſatisfaction. 'Tis the property of homogeneous things to unite themſelves together; we love naturally thoſe who have incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations like to our own, or have ſome relation to us. A Learned man takes great delight to be with Sono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; a Warlike man with Shoudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58553:78"/>a Merchant with thoſe that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick. There are none but Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Wits agreeable to the whole World, becauſe they have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of transforming themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ſhapes without trouble, as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus:</hi> They are Lawyers in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Advocates, Divines with Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church, Captains and Engineers with men of Martial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; ſo that they ſeem to be born and bred to all the Profeſſions of a Civil life. As theſe Wits are rare, ſo men cannot eſteem them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; but notwithſtanding they have received from Nature theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable diſpoſitions to acquire an extraordinary Merit, yet they obtain it not without vaſt pains. Long ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are requiſite, frequent Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, learned Conferences, painful Voyages, to expoſe themſelves to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perils, and to have a conſummate experience of all the Profeſſions of the World; and then muſt make great haſte to arrive at the perfection before the age of fifty years.</p>

                  </note> it cauſes an alteration in thoſe that love it, and ſometimes puffs them up: The more men know, the more they would know: The Sciences are ſo linkt one to another, that the firſt draws on the ſecond, and that the reſt that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. This happens, becauſe we know nothing but by our Senſes, which preſent to us the Images of things ſucceſſively. <hi>Plato</hi> aſſured us, that our Souls were naturally knowing, and that the Objects, which made their impreſſions on our Senſes, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to diſplay the conſus'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were innate in us. As
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58553:79"/>when men preſent us with two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſame matter, of the ſame form, and of the ſame weight, we ſay, they are equal; and this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is found within us, makes us remember and conclude at the ſame inſtant, that there is an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal term called Equality: And when we behold things which appear beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, we think there is ſuch a term as is called Beauty. Theſe inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and conſequences cannot be made, but by ſucceſſive gradations, which lead us from one Science to another; and as they always remount towards Univerſal terms, they carry our underſtanding ſo far, that it can never meet with limits to its curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition has often cauſed me to make reflections upon this, that ſublime Wits are more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich in Eſteem and Reputation, than in the gifts of Fortune: And I conceive the reaſon to be, that the Powers of the greateſt Soul in the World are bounded, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Infinity; but when ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts her ſelf to the Sciences with a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58553:80"/>vehement deſire to comprehend them; ſhe applies her ſelf ſo eagerly to that ſhe is about, that her Speculations poſſeſs her entirely; and the more force and light ſhe has, the more ſhe abſtracts them from matter, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alizing the Objects of her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: From hence it comes, that being flown above things purely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, ſhe meets with Charms in her Speculations, which hinder her from deſcending, to reduce into practiſe thoſe things ſhe has conceiv'd. The Caſſock is comparably more ſuitable to theſe ſoating Wits, than the Sword; becauſe it furniſhes them with many occaſions of making themſelves admired. The Pulpit would cauſe them to be followed by all people; and we ſeldom ſee a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preacher grow gray without a Benefice. The Bar alſo might prove very advantageous to them. Eſteem and Wealth do continually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany their eloquence: Moreover, they have the ſatisfaction to ſpeak before ſuch as are as well able to judge of their Learning, as of their Froceſs.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:58553:80"/>
               <p>But to conſider it aright, to what purpoſe ſerves this lofty Science in a Military man, but to render him poor, by hindring him from applying himſelf to his Fortune? What profit can he draw from the Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> or from the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi> of <hi>Quintilian?</hi> I do very well approve of his ſtudying them until he comes to the age of Sixteen or Seventeen; foraſmuch as before that time he is not fit for any thing. But when he ſhall have acquired that at the Colledge which a good Scholar might have learnt, he ſhould ſhare out his time, and become a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band thereof, allotting part to the Exerciſes which are proper for him, and part to the Sciences which are uſeful to him. He ſhould learn the uſe of his Arms, to manage his Horſe, Geometry, Fortification, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography; the Latine and French Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, the Art of Deſigning; and if he can, he may add to theſe the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, German, Italian and Spaniſh Tongues. Theſe Qualifications are ſufficient for a Military perſon, and can alſo render any Private man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58553:81"/>greeable and uſeful at the ſame time to any great Lord. The ſublime Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are too tedious and too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; and I dare affirm, that they endamage more than they advantage any perſon who will not wear the Caſſock; foraſmuch, as I have ſaid, they are inconſiſtant with the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe things that ſhould render him excellent in his Profeſſion; and being out of the reach of great Lords, they value them not, becauſe they will never give themſelves the trouble of underſtanding them.</p>
               <p>And indeed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Age quod agis.</hi>
                  </note> the application of which I ſpeak, is ſo neceſſary for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in his Profeſſion, that it is impoſſible to ſucceed well without it:

                  </note> for the faculties of our Soul are too feeble to graſp many things at the ſame time; ſhe has ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to contain but one, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when ſhe follows her own natural inclination. The proof of this will appear more clearly by the conſideration of one of a mean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who has no other lights, but thoſe of Nature and common ſenſe. If a Citizen deſignes to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58553:81"/>Rich by Trafick, he will learn Arithmetick, and the Prizes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes; he will inform himſelf of thoſe things that can be bought cheap in one place, and ſold dear in another: All his thoughts will be full of theſe remarks; his ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will gather no other conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from his diſcourſes: his ordinary converſation will be with thoſe of his own profeſſion; he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex himſelf with the ſubtile Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the School; he will not trouble himſelf to ſeek any thing in the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> or in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s Commentaries. His whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary conſiſts of his Veſpers and Mattins to ſay his Prayers to God, and his Almanack to know the time of Fayrs. He will uſe an ordinary prudence to eſcape unhappy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and beware of Cheats and Bankrupts. He will propound to himſelf an incorruptible fidelity to gain Credit, and at length he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Rich, without the aſſiſtance of any other Science, than that which he ſhall have learn'd from his own Reaſon and Experience. A Farmer
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58553:82"/>leſs Spiritual yet than a Citizen; who is born with a Plough in his hand, and has never learnt any thing but to cultivate the Ground, and to feed Cattle, ſhall advance his Fortune ſooner by hiring a Farm, than a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher with all his Notions and admirable Speculations. From hence we may conclude, the greateſt Wits, and the ſublimeſt Sciences are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for obtaining the goods of Fortune; but the middle are far the moſt proper for this purpoſe; and the art conſiſts in chuſing well his profeſſion, and in reſigning himſelf entirely up to it, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerruption: the great and ſublime Genius's are as Diamonds, which all the World eſteem, both for their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre and their rarity; but they ſerve onely for Ornaments. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that they are not good but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and finds them very unfit for the Government of Republicks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their elevation has no corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the weakneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and conſequently cannot form Laws, which may be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Infirmity. If he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58553:82"/>them from the Government upon this account, I may more juſtly ſay, that they are alſo uncapable of Obedience and Subjection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vain would they ſeek their Fortune in the Retinue of Princes and Great Lords.

I ſtand in need of more material, and more ſenſible Subſtances, which are better proportionable to what I am. I endeavour to diſſwade my Friends from the choice of unprofitable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and perſwade them to the ſtudy of thoſe Sciences, which may introduce them into the Road of Fortune: and for this, I require but a very ordinary and mean ſpirit, who diligently applies himſelf to pleaſe his Maſter, who gives him his advice with all ſubmiſſion, and the deference that is due to him; who can punctually execute his orders, who is incorruptible in his Truſt, who
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58553:83"/>loves his Intereſt and his Service above all other things in the World, who does nothing with regret, who appears always well-affected, and ready to ſerve and obey. Theſe Qualifications are much more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial then Rhetorick and Philoſophy; yet this will not make me of the Sentiment of one of our Duke's and Peers, who believed that a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man offended his Nobility when he ſpake Latine. For my part, I do not onely approve of underſtanding it, but moreover conceive it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for one to pretend to the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an accompliſht perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ſome knowledge alſo of the Arts and Sciences. I ſeek medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity in all things, and do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that he ought to ſoar ſo high in theſe ſublime Speculations, as not to deſcend again; that would be to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a Voyage to the Globe of the Moon, from which he will reap no other benefit than the dangers of its Influences. So I cannot ſuffer, that he ſhould be ignorant in common Affairs: for ſeeing that his Birth expoſes him to the converſation of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58553:83"/>Great Lords, he ought to ſpeak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently and properly before them. Would it not be ridiculous to place <hi>Nurenburgh</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Germany?</hi> to ſay that the <hi>Bucentaure</hi> is the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Charlemain</hi> were intimate Friends, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in dying without Confeſſion? If he diſcourſes of the War, or is to render an account of a Siege, or the circumſtances of a Battle; is there any thing more ſhameful than to be ignorant of the terms? If he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Hunting, or the exerciſes of the Academy, &amp; cannot ſpeak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereof is he not obliged to be ſilent, or elſe muſt become a Laughing-ſtock to thoſe that hear him? This ſort of Ignorance is not pardonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ought to know what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns his Profeſſion. I wiſh alſo that he had read the antient and modern Poets, and could make Verſes in our Language; provided that this Study be his divertiſement onely, and not his buſineſs: For this Gentility of ſpirit gives him often a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in good conferences, and is not

A man well accompliſht, and of a good diſpoſition, is happy, if he meets with a Maſter that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in Learning: This is a means of diverting him, and gaining his Friendſhip: he does not every day finde occaſions of rendring him great and important Services. We ſeldom ſee our ſelves in a condition of ſaving our Maſters Life, or of negotiating his affairs ſo diſcreety, that our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof may procure him the moſt honourable Charges of the State. Theſe are chances of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary happineſs, which are not often in our power: but if we have any ingenuity, we may render our ſelves agreable by our complaiſance,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58553:84"/>inſinuate our ſelves into his thoughts, diſpel his Melancholy, and prevent his Orders by our diligence. Great Services make a fairer ſhow, and are more obliging and advantageous; he that neglects the performance thereof, paſſes for one that is Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or Treacherous.</p>
               <p>Honour and Juſtice, which engage us therein, diminiſh in ſome meaſure the reſentments which Maſters ought to have of them, becauſe we our ſelves are intereſſed therein by our own glory: But theſe little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of pleaſing being continued and often reiterated, are received as Tokens of our inclination and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and make a marvellous Progreſs in the minde of the Lord, who knows how to judge well thereof.

               <p>I Have made this Repetition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of great importance to avoid this kinde of ſubjection; and that which remains to be ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Conduct of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with his Maſter, preſuppoſes that he has made a better choice. It is certain, that it appertains not to all people, to form indiſſoluble bonds of Friendſhip: This Sacred knot of civil Society, requires many other circumſtances, of which all the world is not capable. Goodneſs is the beſt foundation, and the pleaſure of mutual Offices and of Converſation makes the continuance thereof as long as the life of them whom it has uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I am ſenſible that men add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the equality of perſons, without which it is ſomewhat defective: And ſo we cannot properly call this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will Friendſhip, that happens between
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58553:86"/>Maſter and Servant. But I anſwer, that this inequality of Birth and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune does not hinder true Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, providing that the reſpect of the Inferiour tempers it accordingly. It would be a ſort of tyranny, not to love him whom we eſteem worthy of our favour, and an intolerable injuſtice to deprive a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the moſt delightful function of his life. For my part I aſſert, that men may love their Maſter, and ought ſo to do, if they would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved again. This being ſuppoſed, Reaſon requires, that the Qualities of which I have ſpoken, meet in the bond of this Friendſhip, but more apparently in the perſon of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant, than in the Maſter; becauſe the one muſt court it by his ſervices, and purchaſe it by the effica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie of his Merit, not being able to poſſiſs it but as a favour; and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows it as a Gratuity, which depends more from his generoſity, than his acknowledgements. From this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple I infer, that the Attendant ſhould be pliable and expert, and contribute to the Pleaſures of his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58553:86"/>Maſter; that he ſhould do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavour to conform himſelf to his humours, and not omit any thing that will either ſerve him or pleaſe him: for to ſucceed well in this caſe, he has need of a good judgement to diſcern what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter loves, and an inclination to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form very well what he undertakes. A too profound reſpect is not always advantageous; it would be more convenient if it proceeded from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, rather than Fear: The Quality of a Gentleman cannot accommodate it ſelf with that villanous Paſſion of the Soul, which is ſuitable to none but Valets. The reſpect which he renders, ought to be accompani'd with a certain freedom, which makes him known to be what he is. And a man of Senſe will never exact more than is due to him.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen ſome, who running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other extreme, became ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with Princes, that they grew impudent: This is a manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which has ever ſeem'd to me ſottiſh and ridiculous, and which is never practiſed but by dizzy-headed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58553:87"/>people: it is not becauſe it does not ſometimes ſucceed well at Court, and in the Families of Great Lords, and that theſe men do not attain their ends; for they demand their aſſiſtance with ſuch impudence &amp; importunity, that Princes cannot tell how to refuſe them: And being for the moſt part more brisk than judicious, they are commonly great talkers; and if they cannot perſwade, they deafen. Thus theſe free and pratling humours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not capable of ſerious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hazard all things, and are not very ſenſible of contempts or abuſes. They are expos'd every hour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive affronts; if they are driven out at the door, they will enter again at the window, and do never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be in diſgrace. But whatſoever ſwerves from the Rules of Wiſdom and Modeſty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not become a perſon of Honour; his Scope is not only to make a Fortune, but to preſerve his Reputation: The moſt profitable courſe is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, when it ceaſes to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. Men may gather Wealth by deceipt, if they are willing to be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58553:87"/>reputed Cheats; and commonly they who are too greedy and covetous, have little regard to their Eſteem. Our Souls are not capable of two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Paſſions at the ſame time: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality is contrary to their Nature, which is to tranſport themſelves vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently towards the Object which has the predominance; and every one knows that balances made equal, have no inclination. A wiſe man may have theſe two Paſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he conſiders that of Honour as eſſential and neceſſary, the other as profitable and accidental: The firſt cannot miſs its Effect, becauſe it is wholly in his power, and its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tyranny cannot extort any thing from him contrary to Vertue: But the Effect of the laſt is not wholly in his power. Therefore we ſee that men do not pardon the faults which we commit againſt our Honour, but they eaſily pity the unhappy ſucceſs of our Fortune.</p>
               <p>I have often obſerved, that great Wits, who have this fire which hears and enlightens them, are ſubject to violent Paſſions; but they always
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58553:88"/>weigh down the ballance on the moſt honeſt part. They ſay that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> had two principal ones, which were his Maſters during the whole courſe of his life; Love and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Never was any man ſo laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and took ſo much pleaſure in winning the favours of Ladies; but the enrag'd deſire of commanding was ever predominant over that of Love; he made Glory his Idol, to which he ſacrific'd his thoughts, his ſleep, his cares, his ſweats, his toils, his perils, and even his love it ſelf. This Paſſion reign'd ſo imperiouſly in his Soul, that it ſuffered none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but as ſlaves which ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd only for her own ſervice. For my part, I conceive that that of gaining Eſteem and Honour ought to poſſeſs the ſoveraign command in a Gentleman's minde, foraſmuch as Wealth, far from being contrary to his fortune, naturally produces effects, which ſucceſsfully tend to the ſame end: For if he aſpires to the repute of more than an ordinary man, he is obliged to perform ſuch noble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as may procure him this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58553:88"/>and this neceſſity engages him to apply himſelf ſeriouſly to the knowledge of the affairs of his own Profeſſion, and to behave himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner, that he may not give any perſon an occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning his proceedings. This is ſo neceſſary a circumſtance for his fortune and his eſtabliſhment, that it makes the very foundation of all his hopes; ſeeing it is manifeſt, that his Maſter cannot love him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he eſteems him; and cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem him, unleſs he be convinced of his merits. They may tell me, that the good opinion we have of things does not always oblige us to love them; and that a rational man will acknowledge the valour of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, without bearing any friendſhip towards him: but this objection is not pertinent to the ſubject of which I treat, foraſmuch as our enemy may conſerve his good qualities, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe our friendſhip: But a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man receives an advantage by his Worth, <hi>viz.</hi> he renders himſelf amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Maſters ſight, &amp; this eſteem and friendſhip accompany one the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58553:89"/>other, as a ſhadow the body, and are ever inſeparable.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid that he ought to avoid Impudence, and that ridiculous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, which ſavours too much of the Buffoon. I do not adviſe him to be continually ſo reſerved, that he dares not ſpeak a witty word, if he findes an opportunity of doing it diſcreetly: Silence is aſwel a mark of ſtupidity as of reſpect. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient if he ſpeaks to the purpoſe, and never becomes importunate: he may entertain his Maſter with ſome privacies in particular, if he perceives that his converſation plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him, provided he be careful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his diſtance in the preſence of ſtrangers.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> That he ought to endeavour to be employed in the negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Maſter's Affairs at Court; and wherefore?</head>
               <p>THe World is a Comedy; the beſt Actors are thoſe that repreſent their Parts the moſt naturally; but the wiſeſt do not always act Kings and Great Lords, and are ſeldome the Hero's of the Play. In the Subject whereof I treat, the moſt difficult is that of the inferiour; he has much to act before he can hope for any thing: his faults retort upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his ſpectators are ever more ready to abuſe than to favour him. 'Tis upon this account that he ought to keep a continual guard againſt his Imprudence, as well as againſt the Malice of his Enemies. A grand do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick cannot be without intrigues; and we ſeldome ſee a Gentleman in a great Family ſo much reſpected by the others, as that they will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the leaſt to his Employments.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58553:90"/>'Tis not ſufficient to deſerve them better than his Competitours; but it is convenient to promote his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with great circumſpection and cunning, <hi>viz.</hi> To demand them moſt ſubmiſſively, or to employ the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Maſters confidents for to ſuggeſt to him that he has deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them. There is no Juſtice ſo exact, nor Bounty ſo perfect, but receives more life by being follici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: There is no impudence in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding great Employs, when men know themſelves to be capable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging them honourably; they have always for a pretext the paſſion of ſerving their Maſter, and making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear their fidelity. I do particularly eſteem that Gentleman happy, who is employed by a Great Lord to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate his affairs at Court; if he has any ingenuity, he promotes his own intereſt together with his Maſters, by giving there great evidences of his ſufficiency, which beat him out a path to arrive at greater preferments. There are many accompliſht perſons who are not unhappy, but becauſe they are unknown; thoſe who walk
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58553:90"/>in the long Gallery without being admitted into the Council-Chamber, are like the Souls in Limbo, who cannot go to Paradiſe. The moſt difficult thing is to make their worth known. Kings have Eyes and Ears throughout the whole World, and their inclinations are not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to confer Honours on Great Lords than on private Gentlemen: If they have an advantage by their Birth, theſe have one by their good Qualifications. Nature is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in the diſtribution of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ſhe ſeldom beſtows an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Wit, on ſuch as ſhe cauſes to be born in the midſt of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and ſhe often delights to give but very little Wealth to the moſt ingenious perſons: But let us rather ſay, that is an effect of the Wiſdom of God, who orders her operations.</p>
               <p>I once heard a paradox proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which had great relation to what I have aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A certain man extol'd the mighty progreſs of his Arms in <hi>Germany,</hi> and maintain'd in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58553:91"/>that his Valour, his vaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and his noble Exploits, were the moſt perfect works of Providence that ever were; that without him, the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> had rais'd it ſelf to an Univerſal Monarchy, to the utter Ruine and Extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion: that it was moſt evident by the Miracles of his Life, that God had Created him for the ſafety of Mankinde; that the unlimited greatneſs of his Courage was a preſent of God's Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a viſible effect of his infinite goodneſs. Say rather, repli'd the King, that it is a token of his Wrath and Indignation:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quaedam remedia triſtiora ſunt ipſo morbo.</hi> Plu.</note> If the War which I wage be a Remedy, 'tis more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable than the Diſeaſe. God never departs from mediocrity to go into Extremes without Chaſtiſing ſome body: It is a ſigne of his love to the people, when he inſpires but ordinary Souls into Kings. He who is not framed out of the pureſt mould, cannot conceive any grand projects. Glory and Ambition leave him to his repoſe: if he applies himſelf to his affairs, his dominion is the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58553:91"/>if he diſcharges himſelf of his cares upon one of his Subjects, to whom he imparts his Authority, the worſt that can happen is, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes his Fortunes at the expence of the Publike, that he impoſes ſome Subſidies to raiſe moneys whereby to advance his Friends, and that he cauſes his equals to grumble, who can hardly brook his Power; but theſe Evils are very inconſiderable if compared with thoſe which the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of a haughty Prince produce: The exceſſive Paſſion which he has for Renown, by deſtroying his own repoſe, does neceſſarily oblige him to deprive his Subjects of the ſame: He cannot endure any equals in the World; he accounts all his Enemies, who will not be his Vaſſals. This is a Torrent which makes all places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate through which it ſlides: and by carrying his Arms as far as his Hopes, he fills the world with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Miſery, and Confuſion. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is the effect of Ambition, and War is the Recreation of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: 'tis an evil which entertains a multitude of others in its retinue,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58553:92"/>and there is not one to be found com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it. The Quarrel of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> hath formerly intereſſed all the States of the World, becauſe they both pretended to an Univerſal Monarchy: their Courages were ſo undaunted, and their Vertue ſo equal, that Valour not being able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the point, left the deciſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to Fortune. The Enterprizes of great Princes are always grievous to their own Subjects; their Lawrels caſt ſuch ſhadows as Blaſt the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Plants, and produce none but hurtful Fruits themſelves. By this Reaſoning we may conclude, that Providence, which watches perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally over us, never brings forth a haughty Prince, but from time to time to curb the Licentiouſneſs of the People; and her bounty is much greater in beſtowing mean and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, than ambitious and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spirits on Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>And for my part, I aſſert from the like conſequence, that the ſame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is conſpicuous in the diſtribution of Favours among all ſorts of men:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58553:92"/>for as ſhe gives to no-body all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections together, ſo ſhe produces not one altogether uncapable of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; and it is but reaſonable, that ſhe ſhould beſtow leſs Wit on thoſe who are born rich, than on ſuch as a low Extraction, or an unhappy diſaſter has impoveriſhed. The firſt have need onely of an ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to live happily, the laſt muſt be owners of extraordinary Merits, to ſupply their neceſſities. It was the ſaying of a Greek Poet, That Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence awakens Arts, and Poverty is the Mother of Invention: there is great pobability, that this Author did not elevate his thoughts to the firſt cauſe of this effect. Poverty of it ſelf does nothing that's worthy; but it is the temperament, which God has made in the Soul of him, who is filled with Light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; as Simplicity and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are ingredients in the Souls of thoſe who abound in Wealth and Riches.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> That he may be advanc'd from the ſervice of a Great Lord, to that of the King or Prince: And that a Maſter ought to treat a Gentleman courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</head>
               <p>I Have ſpoken in my firſt Part, of the wonderful progreſs which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality make in the Court, when their wit and judgement are equal to their Riches and Fortune. I have nothing more to ſay to them; my deſigne being only to advertiſe a Gentleman, that as I have ſet no bounds to his Worth, ſo he ought to preſcribe none to his Fortune. One of our Conſtables had no cauſe to complain of changing his Maſter; the ſupport of the Trunk is ever more firm than that of the Branches: There is not the leaſt imprudence in paſſing from the retinue of a great Lord to the ſervice of a King, or of ſome other ſoveraign Prince, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58553:93"/>that it be done fairly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treachery. If he loves us, he will be extremely glad of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; and if he does not love us, we do not owe him that dull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance of conſuming our life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyranny of his ingratitude and injuſtice. Our ſervices ought to be ſincere and faithful, but not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual: Our condition would be worſe than that of a ſlave, if we were obliged to do all for him, and nothing for our ſelves: Reaſon and Nature teach us to purſue our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, when they are not contrary to the Maximes of Honour.</p>
               <p>For my part, I am well ſatisfi'd with a Great Lord, who is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally liberal, when he gives his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the good words which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, although he does them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courteſie. This teſtimony of his friendſhip is obliging, and may become profitable in time: but I meet with nothing more rare in the mouths of perſons of Quality, than this ſort of Commendation; they will rather praiſe the Horſes paces, than the Teachers skill; and if a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58553:94"/>Gentleman by his diſcreet manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes their affairs proſper, they will attribute the cauſe thereof to ſome other circumſtance rather than to his conduct. This Injuſtice as a contagion is communicated from Parents to Children; 'tis an antient tradition of which husbands and their wives make a myſtery; and it paſſes for a politick Rule in Noble Families: But I cannot forbear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that this Maxime is as erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as it is ungrateful, and it ought not to be entertain'd by any generous or noble Soul.</p>
               <p>Can any one deny that Praiſe and Eſteem are the true and eſſential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Vertue? And that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Heroes</hi> did not propound to themſelves Glory as their Object,

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58553:94"/>moſt ſlothful. Therefore if ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our eſteem and our applauſe, is it not an errour to believe that men ought not to ſpeak well of thoſe that poſſeſs her? and if an inferiour em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys his Vertue only to ſerve his Maſter more advantageouſly, can he conceal it without being guilty of ingratitude and baſeneſs? Why does he not take as great pleaſure in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling the Merit of a Gentleman that ſerves him, as in boaſting of his fine Horſes, or in deſcribing his rich Farniture, and his ſtately Houſes? He is Maſter of all theſe, but of a Gentleman after a more noble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He cannot ſet forth his Worth, without adding at the ſame time ſomewhat to his own Glory. Would it not be more advantageous for him to make appear that he has for a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick a Perſon worthy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a whole Province? and that he receives homages and reſpects from one to whom no man can ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58553:95"/>he does it from a principle of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, this Paſſion muſt needs be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, ſeeing there is no equality in their Fortune; and if he fears to create any vain thoughts thereby in his Servant, from that inſtant in which he ſuſpects him inclinable to this extravagance, he becomes inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, by imputing to him a crime, to which he is not obnoxious: It would be more reaſonable that he ſhould turn the Medial, and think that by publiſhing his Worth, he ſhould binde him to his ſervice with a new chain; that this proof of his friendſhip would make him in love with his ſubjection; that 'tis to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him juſtice, which he receives as a favour; and that at length all the World will judge, that he cheriſhes in another the worth which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes in himſelf.</p>
               <p>I finde it not ſtrange, that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Spirit is not capable of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; but I cannot conceive how a man of Senſe ſhould be inveagled to follow thoſe Errours, which are not authoriz'd, but by the ignorant multitude, who cannot eſteem that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58553:95"/>which they underſtand not. Yet I could pardon this in a Country-Lord, who fancies he is not Maſter there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he has an imperious tone to make himſelf reverenced by the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and reſpected by his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks; who perſwades himſelf, that his Grandeur conſiſts in ſeeing thoſe about him proſtrate at his ſect; who holds a Council without intrigues or affairs; who confounds Vanity with the point of Honour; who puts no difference between Glory and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; and who frames a ridiculous Chimera of his own quality, which makes him unworthy of the reſpects and ſervices of any brave or gallant man. He who does not know what he is himſelf, will hardly finde out what we are: he muſt firſt do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſtice, before he can be capable of rendring it to others. Greatneſs and Meanneſs are two oppoſite terms, but not contrary; theſe two extremes are eaſily united by the courteſie of the one, and the reſpect of the other: A Lord is as much obliged to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to us, as we are to be reſpectful to him. Arrogance produces not that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58553:96"/>effect which ſeeks in the minde of a Gentleman, it exaſperates more than ſubjects him; it extinguiſhes all his friendſhip, becauſe it perſwades him, that he is not in the leaſt beloved, but has great injuſtice done him: And if the neceſſity of his affairs, or the hope of his fortune, hinders him from ſhaking off his Yoak,

I would adviſe perſons of Quality always to inſpire love into Gentlemen, and fear into Valets. Love in the Soul of a man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, makes all things pleaſant and eaſie: the Roſes which he gathers for his Maſter, are ever without Throns; he ſlights all hardſhip, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or perils; he intereſts himſelf ſo far in his ſervice, that he looks upon it as his Glory, his point of Honour, and his Satisfaction: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, meaner Servants who have no Senſe, are not capable of great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; their ſcope being to live, and their pleaſure to do nothing, they are ſeldom contain'd within the bounds of their duty, but by the fear of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58553:97"/>leave it, if it brings us to the place whither we tend. The aim of a Gentleman is not to ſeek all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in a Service, it is to make his Fortune; and he would be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, if he ſhould meet with theſe two together. A teachey and Paſſionate diſpoſition is not more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with Juſtice and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than Choler with a good Wit; theſe cannot but eſteem the good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of ſuch as approach them, although they are not diverted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: Sufficiency pleaſes them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they poſſeſs it themſelves, and are very ſenſible, that it is profitable to them in the perſons of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks. It is very difficult to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an even humour in the midſt of a continual harras of weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; the greateſt Souls bear this burthen very impatiently, and receive no ſmall impreſſions from bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; the multiplicity of cares o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelms them, and the people ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them in that manner, as to block up all the Avenues to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations: it does not belong to us to change them; it is ſufficient to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58553:98"/>make our parts known, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them of our affection. Their employments and favours will finde us as ſoon in the Antichamber as in the Cabinet; and to take it aright, their preſents contribute more to our Fortune than their Careſſes.</p>

Let the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Nobility ſpeak their opinions freely, and you ſhall finde them all of one accord, that a particular Gentleman cannot ſeek his Fortune better than in the retinue of a Prince, or a Miniſter of State; that the little Employs which they beſtow upon him, are but ſo many ſteps to mount to higher; that he ought to have a ſubmiſſive Soul, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to begin at the meaneſt Scrvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to arrive at the greateſt honours; that from a Page he ſhould attempt to become a Gentleman-attendant, or Maſter of his Game: but in caſe you ſhould propound to them the charge of Secretary, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it as beneath his Quality, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58553:98"/>ſay, that a Gentleman ought not to wear a Feather, unleſs in his Hat; and that it would be a diſhonour to quit his Sword, to carry a Letter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. I muſt confeſs, that theſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of advice are very competent Judges in this matter, and know ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well how to make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the honour and the profitableneſs of Employments: Doubtleſs they underſtand the point of Honour very well, to aſſure one that it is more Noble to fill his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Drink at his meals, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his thoughts and his intentions in his Letters; that it is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to dreſs Horſes, and whip Pages, than to converſe with Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, and be the Confident of the moſt important Secrets between the Court and him. In my opinion he will take greater pleaſure in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Maſter about his Dogs, and his Hunting, than about his great Negotiations; and his ſufficiency will better appear in chaſing a Beaſt, than in managing thoſe concerns which paſs through his hands. But if they would conſider the advantages of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58553:99"/>theſe Places, they muſt conſult thoſe that have been Secretaries, to learn, that never any one miſſed a Fortune. There are certain myſteries in this art, which it is not permitted to reveal; it is ſufficient to ſay, that an Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon in this employ, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily have an opportunity of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Fortune, without wounding his Honour, or offending his Vertue. 'Tis the moſt fair place in the whole Houſe to acquire Friends, becauſe the Favours and Graces of Princes are diſtributed by his hands, he has a thouſand occaſions every day of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging perſons of Quality, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuch Civilities at firſt or laſt. For my part, I conceive, that the difficulty of the Function has of late days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded moſt Noblemen from it; and that this errour had not crept into the World, but becauſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and to ſpeak truth, he who can acquit himſelf worthily of this Charge, is capable of many other: he muſt not onely have Vertue and Faithfulneſs in his Conduct, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in himſelf all the good qualities of an accompliſht perſon: It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58553:99"/>that he be skill'd in all Arts and Sciences; that he underſtands forrein Languages, and all the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms and elegancies of our own. It is not enough to have a quick Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a tenacious Memory, and a clear Judgement; he muſt alſo have agreeable expreſſions, and make uſe of ſelect words, which ſmell neither of the Pedantry of the School, nor of the Poëtry of <hi>Parnaſſus.</hi> I was always of opinion, that the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult kinde of writing was that of Letters; and I have heard knowing perſons proteſt, that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Epiſtles were worth all his other works. The reaſon is, that a Letter is the true production of our minde, that it is the lively and natural Picture of our thoughts and imaginations; all the excellencies and ſoloeciſms thereof can be attributed to none but to our ſelves alone: we cannot ſay ſo much of our common and familiar diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; our thoughts which preſent themſelves in a crowd, give us not leiſure to make choice of the apteſt expreſſions: But this default is not to be in our Letters; we can adorn
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58553:100"/>them with all the graces of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſeeing we have time to adde both a method and politeneſs to our ſtile. Lawyers in writing their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Prieſts their Sermons, have nothing that is ſo worthy of our eſteem; if we conſider, that theſe Harangues are patcht up of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places, Quotations, Apothegmes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Examples, and Philoſophical Axioms, and modelled by the Rules of Rhetorick, which furniſhes them with Exordiums, Narrations, their pathetical Inferences, and their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. But Letters require not theſe ſtrange ornaments; their Beauties pleaſe us beſt, when they are wholly naked; they begin without Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums, proceed without Narrations, explain without Artifice, prove with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out citing Authors, reaſon without Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, delight and perſwade without tropes and figures. It is certain they ought to be purged from all theſe, foraſmuch as they ceaſe to be good, when they appear learned and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is, in my Judgement, the reaſon that we ſee ſo few Scholars write agreeably, they know nothing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58553:100"/>but what others have ſaid;

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> How it comes to paſs that we are leſs knowing than the Antients.</head>
               <p>A Famous man of our age told me one day,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Campanella.</hi>
                  </note> that he had found out three reaſons, why we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs knowing than the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: He did not attribute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault to the imperfection of times, and the ſucceſſion of years; he was ſufficiently convinc'd, that men were always born, have ever lived and died after one and the ſame manner; and in the time of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> he who did arrive to the age of Eighty years, was accounted very Old.</p>
               <p>The firſt of his Reaſons was, that we ſpent our Youth in the ſtudy of the Greek and Latine Tongues, which are no Sciences, but petty Tyrants, who ſeize on our minds, to remove us farther from them. The ſecond, that we read too much: The third, that we do not reaſon throughly of things. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58553:101"/>perhaps underſtood none but his Nurſes Language; yet he inſtructed his Poſterity in all Parts of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and eterniz'd his Memory by his learned Works. From his time they began to learn the terms of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and Geometry: theſe two Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were ſo common among thoſe of his Nation, that he continually draws Conſequences from theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, without giving himſelf the trouble of explaining them, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that no man was ignorant thereof. From thence they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Logick, and to the other Parts of Philoſophy, which conſiſt in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing certain and manifeſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to draw therefrom infallible Concluſions. This Science was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Rules of Rhetorick, which inſtructed them to put in good order what the other Sciences had taught them; and by ſweet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions joyn'd with the grace of tropes and figures, both to delight and perſwade the Auditory. The ſtudy of that age was, to reſolve dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Queſtions, to diſcover the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Things, to learn the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58553:102"/>by Experiments, and the more occult by Reaſoning. They were better perſwaded by their Perception that fire has a hot quality, than by the Phyſitians authority, who taught, that its property was to heat and to burn.</p>
               <p>Their Sciences were beyond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon more noble than ours,
<note place="margin">

                  </note> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were more free; they acknowledged onely demonſtrative Reaſon for their Miſtreſs, without ſubmitting themſelves to the tyranny or capriciouſneſs of Authors. This method of ſtudying multipli'd the Sects of Philoſophers, and every one maintain'd his Opinion as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it.
<note place="margin">

               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:58553:102"/>
               <p>I am perſwaded that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of times is ſufficient both to deſtroy and aboliſh this Errour. In S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s days, men were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for teaching or reading the Books of this Philoſopher. <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers</hi> who deſcribed our Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, were condemn'd for Hereticks; and Aſtronomers paſs'd for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, when they predicted the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Sun and Moon. <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> the moſt clear and moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wit of the World, reſtabliſht the honour of theſe unhappy men; and recalling them from the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the Curious, whither Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had baniſht them, reſtored them to that liberty, of which the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's of the Church had deprived them. His Authority made them appear reaſonable, and his Sanctity purged all the malice from the minds of Students. After this, conſider whether theſe Regents ought ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly to render themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our ſentiments; and who will aſſure us, that they ſhall not be one day ſuppreſs'd? and that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58553:103"/>our Poſterity ſhall not think them as frivolous and weak, as we conceive them worthy and great? This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our judgements, denotes without doubt both their weakneſs and our own, and makes me conclude with great probability, that an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſon may ſeek among this diverſity of Opinions the moſt ſound by profound and free contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and embrace that without offence which ſeems to him the beſt and the moſt reaſonable. I hope I ſhall be pardon'd for ſpeaking after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for I muſt acknowledge my ſelf more indebted to Nature, than to my Tutours; and having ſpent more than half of my life in Armies, I have had little converſe with Books, but have applied my ſelf chiefly to the ſtudy of the World, to furniſh and ſuccour my Speculations with ſome ſlight obſervations. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Studying, has taught me not to envy the eſteem of the Learned, and to comfort my ſelf without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, that I have not been able to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the leaſt glimpſe of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I look upon them as men who
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58553:103"/>have written much, but not as ſuch as are never deceived: I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they have ſo eſtabliſht their errours among the generality of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſeeing the greateſt part are not always of the beſt ſenſe; and Truth, which ſuffers neither contrariety nor diviſion, does never remain conſtant among them. This conſideration makes me take the liberty, not to conſent always to the ſentiments of the Multitude, and to aſſert, according to my firſt Project, that the Opinion is very ridiculous, which deprives a Gentleman of the Charge of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. And if I was a great Lord, I would alter this cuſtom in my houſe; for indeed, what antipathy is there between the Pen and the Sword? If they grant that a Learned man may be Valiant, will they not alſo allow that a Valiant man may be a Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Knowledge and a good Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion are not leſs requiſite for Conduct, than a great Courage for dangerous and deſperate Attempts.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> That a Gentleman who perceives in himſelf a natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Study, ought to apply himſelf thereto: And that no man can be learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his inclination.</head>
               <p>I Will not deny that a Souldier cannot well be without the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs of diſcourſe and knowledge, which are neceſſary for an expert Secretary; ſo I look not upon this Employ as a thing, to which every Nobleman can aſpire. I pretend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove that it is not beneath a Gentleman, and that ſuch as are ſenſible they have Wit and Capacity enough to diſcharge themſelves well thereof, ought not to contemn it. I farther add to this propoſition, that the Deſigne being to make his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he comprehends very ill his own Intereſt, to refuſe the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain means that conduce thereto, when they are honourable; and I
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58553:104"/>ſee no reaſon why he who knows how to ſerve a Prince-in his Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net with his Pen, ſhould not ſerve him honourably with his Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Enemies.</p>
               <p>I have formerly ſaid, that there is no Obligation in cumbent on a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to render himſelf learned, if he deſignes to follow the War: But I have ever recourſe to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Theſis which I eſtabliſh'd, that every one ought to know his own inclination and natural diſpoſition. This would render a perſon unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the benefits of Nature, not to improve a good Wit; the love of learning, which ſhe inſpires into him, is a ſigne that being not able to prevail againſt Deſtiny nor the Laws which deprive him of worldly Goods, ſhe has reſerv'd for his Portion, Worth and the Sciences. It is his duty to advantage himſelf by this Preſent, which he ought ſo much the leſs to neglect, as it is impoſſible to obtain it whithout her ſuccour: 'Tis ſhe that carries the Flambo before him, when he ſearches to diſcover obſcure and difficult matters; 'tis ſhe that makes
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58553:105"/>him admired in the Pulpit; 'tis ſhe that makes him prevail in Councils; 'tis ſhe that ſweetens his Manners, and rendering him amiable to all the World, raiſes him from the duſt to exalt him above other men.</p>
               <p>It would moſt certainly be a very judicious and advantageous Law, not to permit any to the ſtudy of the Arts and Sciences, but ſuch as Nature has diſpoſed thereto. There is no fear, that by the retrenching of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the number of the Learned would be diminiſhed. This promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous throng of all ſorts of People, who flock to the gates of Colledges, and who loyter under Tutors, ſcarce produces one accompliſht and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Perſon among a thouſand Students. That which they learn, ſerves only to render them importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and make them enterpriſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes above their forces; they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that all the Truths of Philoſophy are ſhut up in their Note-book: and the dulneſs of their brains not being able to conceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objection, they believe that they have attain'd to the utmoſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58553:105"/>of Knowledge; becauſe they ſee nothing but with the eyes of their Tutor, and Nature ſeems not to have given any other faculty to their friends but Memory. We daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that there is nothing more hurtful than this ſort of People, who doubt of things, and do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. 'Tis from them,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Neque enini natae ſunt haereſes, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi dum ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturae bonae intelligun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur non benè</hi> Aug.</note> that ſo many Hereſies have infected Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſo many Scruples have troubled the beſt Conſciences; 'tis from them, proceeded thoſe raſh judgements which fill'd the world with Libertines.</p>
               <p>I remember, that I once heard it aſſerted before a Great and Wiſe Prince, that there was never any worſe Policie, than that of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt; who not being contented with having acquired the Renown of a Valiant Prince, thought that his Glory would be imperfect, if Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould not one day publiſh that he had alſo been the Father of the Learned, and the Reſtorer of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. This Paſſion caus'd him to erect more Colledges in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in divers places eſtabliſh
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58553:106"/>Conveniencies for Scholars. But this Prince did not perceive that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to himſelf a certain Evil, in ſeeking an uncertain good: He thought by this eſtabliſhment to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>France</hi> with Learned men, but he made very few thereby, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it with an infinite number of Perſons unuſeful to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. I mean to ſay, that he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bar with Pettifoggers and Lawyers, the Cities with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent idle Fellows, and the Cloyſters with lazy Monks. In the mean time, he neither extended the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine nor augmented Piety in his Kingdom; but diminiſhed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Souldiers, of Merchants, of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and of Mechanicks, from whom the State hath its Defence, its Riches, its Food and Manufactures. I cannot forbear admiring the Policy of the Turks, which I finde as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as their Religion ridiculous. It is not out of ſottiſhneſs, that they baniſhed Learning out of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was heretofore the great Nurſe of the Muſes, when they ſubdued its Inhabitants, and rendered them tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58553:106"/>to their Empire: Their Conduct is too diſcreet, to impute to them that Barbariſm; of which the World accuſes them, and which they ſeem to affect. They underſtood more judiciouſly than we, the value of the Sciences, when they rendred them not ſo common; and to conclude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, they have done them far leſs injury by reſtraining them to a ſmall number of Ingenious perſons, than we in proſtituting them to all ſorts of men. They conſidered, that as too great a quantity of Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's in a Salle filled with people, offends them by their heat and ſmoak, ſo a vaſt number of Scholars might very much prejudice the State, by thinking to inſtruct their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men. Thus they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Lights of the Arts and Sciences, but have moderated the number of Students; and 'tis in this particular chiefly, that I admire their Judgement, that they follow Nature as a Soveraign Miſtriſs in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Children; they conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Judges of their inclinations to this or that Profeſſion, and according
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58553:107"/>to their natural diſpoſitions they are encouraged and employed.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58553:108"/>than to give them mine. This would indeed be feared, if I had a deſigne to inſtruct them; but I ſpeak to young men, who have as yet onely natural diſpoſitions to do well, and are not determined in the election of their applications.

The Colledge gives us the firſt notions of things; it heaps together Materials for the ſtructure of a beautiful Palace: but 'tis the knowledge of the World, which teaches us the Architecture, which ſhews us the order and connexion of all the parts; which makes us appear accompliſht, without affecting the vanity of being accounted Learned; which poliſhes our diſcourſe and our Manners; which renders us diſcreet
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58553:109"/>in our converſations, and agreeable to the whole World. Without it Learning becomes barbaroas and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, and 'tis the reaſon why perſons of a mean extraction, to whom Nature has given Wit, and the Univerſity Learning, finde it ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a matter to get their Bread: they almoſt ever appear ſuch as they are; becauſe they receiving a tincture from the filth of their education, which having no reſemblance with that of perſons of Quality, cannot conceal their natural difference. The greateſt art to purge a Gentleman of this Intection, is to bring him forth early into the World, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him ſelect diſcourſes, to oblige him to make his Court to perſons of Quality, to make him obſerve all the Punctilio's of a gentile and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous deportment; to give him a certain boldneſs in all his actions, without impudence or affectation; to render him civil without debaſing himſelf, and complaiſant without flattering others; to enjoyn him the converſation of Ladies, and permit him to carry on ſome intrigues with
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58553:110"/>them. Truly, the moſt prudent and learned receive oftentimes very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Leſſons from the ignorant of this Sex. It ſeems that Nature created it not onely for our delight, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to give us Rules whereby we might become more agreeable. Beauty has a certain efficacious power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it renders us wiſe and diſcreet, as much by hazard as by any reſult of our Reaſon: And as that has right to charm us, ſo we ſuppoſe that we have the ſame to pleaſe it; and not being able to ſatisfie our ſelves without the fruition thereof, we moſt ſervently embrace all the means that may render us amiable. This Paſſion inſtructs us much better than Rhetorick, the art of perſwading, and diſcovers to us all the graces of Eloquence: It compares our actions, it regulates our Steps, it makes us gentile, it quickens our Fancy, it poliſhes and a wakens our Wit, and it is very profitable, when it runs not into excets; it is like to that liquour which exhilarates the better ſort, but intoxicates the Rabble. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not permit it to any but
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58553:110"/>good Wits, who take it as a means to perfect themſelves in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World, and not thereby to become Vicious. The moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things are corrupted by a bad uſe; 'tis in our power not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelves faulty by our modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our Condition would be worſe than that of the Beaſts, if we ſhould abſtain from every thing, that carries danger along with it: The Fire which warms us, may alſo Burn us: the Air which we Breath, may be Infected: and the Wine which comforts and nouriſhes us, may in like manner make us Drunk: And from hence would it be reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we ought to be deprived of the uſe of Fire, Air, and Wine? It's the ſame with our Paſſions as with our Arms, they ſerve for our defence, when they obey us; but they have a contrary effect, when they paſs into the hands of our Enemies. We repreſent them as Monſters, for want of knowing them; their force proceeds from the weakneſs of our Reaſon: let us give it leiſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them throughly, it will
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58553:111"/>eaſily ſubject them: 'Tis then that it will appoint them to good uſes, and that Love it ſelf, as dangerous as it is, will ceaſe to be hurtful: The moſt Renowned Antient and Modern Captains have found out a way of adjuſting this with their Employments; they have accounted it onely a ſlight Barricado, which could not put a ſtop to the ſucceſs of their Enterprizes, nor to the progreſs of their Glory. The Learned have purſued it as the Soul of Nature, the Bond of civil ſociety, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Pleaſure and Peace. The Devout have made it a neceſſary Vertue, and the principle of Charity, which unites them with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And for my part, I propound it as a light, which heating the Heart, enlightens the Minde to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Excellencies of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World, which I eſteem ſo neceſſary for an accompliſht Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

And you (replyed the Courtier) if you knew how to live with Princes, would not make ſo bad chear. It is true, that this Moroſe and Pedantick Philoſophy is not deſign'd for Gentlemen; they are born to be ſociable, and ought to underſtand all the Maximes of the World. Complaiſant humours, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with this practical knowledge, gain and raviſh the friendſhip of all people; becauſe they know how to ſet forth gracefully and pertinently the Talents of Nature, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Sciences, which they have acquired.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:58553:112"/>
               <p>I ſay moreover, that it has often made accompliſht perſons, without the aſſiſtance of Learning. The World is a great Book, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us continually; Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are living Studies, which are not at all inferiour to Books: Good Conferences are like Flints, which from a cold and dark heap, produce heat and light, if men ſtrike them one againſt another. The familiar Diſcourſes of two or three good Wits, may be more advantageous to us, than the empty diſputations of all the Pedants of the Univerſities together; they vent more Matter in one day, than we read in a Library in three. The action and air of the Countenance have certain Charms, which have a great influence on our minds; for every one confeſſes that an Oration ſpoken by a good Orator, appears great and lofty, although it be pen'd in common terms, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of ordinary conceptions: I muſt acknowledge, that a Perſon onc. caus'd me to admire his Verſes, when he recited them in a good tone; but giving me them to read, very
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58553:112"/>much diminiſh'd the eſteem I had for them: and there is great probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the reaſon of this alteration proceeded from the harmony which was then wanting. Although our Senſes are diſtinct and ſeparate, there is continually a great correſpondence between them, that from one the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Object paſſes inſenſibly into another: The Ear receives the ſound, and the Idea's which it conveys to our imagination, have ſo great relation with the Order which our judgement frames in our thoughts, that it is even ſurpriz'd by this conformity, becauſe it has no time to digeſt that impreſſion which is made by this harmony. We ſhould not look upon as ſtrange, this effect of good Orations and agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, if we call to minde that of Muſical inſtruments touch'd by the hands of an exquiſite Maſter: There are Tunes which inſpire ſadneſs, and ſweetly incline our Souls to languiſh; there are Airs which rejoyce and make our Hearts merry, and pleafingly compel our Feet to dance to their time. They ſay, that <hi>Alexander</hi> one
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58553:113"/>day excited by the muſick of a Harp, took Arms, and plaid the part of a Common Souldier; and we daily ſee that the ſound of Drums and Trumpets animates us to engage our Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> himſelf charm'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſions of the Evil Spirit in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his Father-in-law by the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Harmony. Without doubt, the Voice perſwades and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs much more than Reading; the one is accompani'd with certain Spirits which we may call Living, and the other is nothing but the Pourtraicture of the thoughts of a dead Perſon: So in like manner we are more ſenſibly concern'd at the occurrence of Affairs, than at the relation that is made us thereof. A man who has Travelled and been long Voyages, underſtands much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſituation of Places, than he who has learnt them only by Maps and Sea-charts: And we cannot but acknowledge that an Old Souldier, who has ſeen many Sieges, Storms and Battels, underſtands the War better, than one who is inſtructed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58553:113"/>only by Books. A Great Lawyer well read in the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts,</hi> is not always a good Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor: I would ſooner take the advice of an Advocate well verſed in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and who is grown hoary in the Palace. Phyſick it ſelf with all its Aphoriſms is very dangerous in the brain of a young Doctor; it is not enough that he has a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> if he has had no experience in Diſeaſes, whereby he might underſtand to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Remedies which his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches him. The Theory of things is always uncertain, if it be not reduc'd into practice: I affirm the ſame of all other Profeſſions. A Gentleman born for the Court and for the War, will never become a Souldier by Books, nor a Courtier in the Country. The World, which lends us its Elements to form our exiſtence, attributes to it ſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the faculty of rendring us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht. This knowledge is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Practice and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which we make of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent profeſſions of a Civil Life: for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58553:114"/>as they have their diſtinctions, they have alſo their Rules and their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The diverſity we meet with not onely among Nations, but in Cities, between ſeveral Orders and Profeſſions, is a moſt wonderful thing. You will ſay, that Nature delights to truckle under Cuſtome. The humours of a Gentleman are altogether different from thoſe of a Merchant; their Civilities, their Compliments, their forms of Writing, have no reſemblance; and among the Nobility it ſelf, thoſe of the Court, have quite another air from thoſe of the Country. We ought to know all theſe varieties, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our ſelves wholly to that of our Profeſſion. Citizens Gallantry would make but a little progreſs in obtaining the favours of a Court-Lady: So to take it in a right ſenſe, that which we call a very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht Gentleman, is one of the moſt perfect works of Nature and Art. Of Nature, becauſe it is requiſite that ſhe gives him a good ſhape, a good meen, an inclination to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Actions, and an honeſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58553:114"/>'Tis upon this Foundation that Art labours to accompliſh ſo beautiful a ſtructure, in poliſhing his Minde by the knowledge of the Arts and Sciences, and his deportment by the Exerciſes of his Body. For to ſucceed happily herein, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin betimes; 'tis a great Enterprize, tedious and difficult, which deſerves all our application.</p>

St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> admirably-well expreſſes the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this Cuſtome, in ſaying, that it is as a Nail driven into a Poſt with a Hammer; after the firſt and ſecond ſtroak, we may draw it out with very little difficulty; but when it is once driven up to the Head, the Pincers not being able to take any hold, it cannot be drawn out but by the deſtruction of the Wood it ſelf. Debauchery has certain Charms which inſinuate themſelves moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly into a young man's minde: 'Tis a Thief which breaks into Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when the Maſters are aſleep; it comes to us with a ſmiling Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it is always bedeckt with the Ornaments of the pleaſure which it propoſes to us; it enters into our Hearts to ſeduce our Sentiments; it guides us to the brink of a Precipice in a moſt delicious way ſtrown with Flowers, and it embraces us &amp; takes us about the Neck onely to Strangle us:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58553:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>As it is a mortal Enemy to Vertue, it always turns its back upon the path to Fortune; from the time that it ſeizeth on a man, it governs him as it pleaſes.

I have known ſome, that proſperity has purſued through all places, and from whom Fortune ſeemed never able to gain their conſent, onely to Elevate them. Theſe perceive too late, that Time is Bald behinde, when they are reduced to Poverty and Want; and if Age kindles in them a ſpark of Reaſon, they endeavour then, but in vain, to recal and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him. Theſe are bad players at Tennis, who are forc'd to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Ball: And as they are not accuſtomed to Labour or Subjection, being abandoned by their Friedd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58553:116"/>and deſtitute of a ſubſiſtance, they from Luxury and Debauchery run into the moſt extreme Wickedneſs. Then they quit the Court, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of doing duty at the Prince's Palace, they take up their ſtation on ſome High-way. They are never without Almanacks to know the Country-Fayres and Marts. Theſe are a ſort of Merchants who ſell all, and buy nothing; and in the end their Deſtiny, or rather their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, prepares for them a Fortune at the end of a Gibbet, or upon a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, the frequenting the company of Fools is not ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and does not cauſe a man to make ſuch dreadful Lapſes; but 'tis a Barricado which always blocks up the way to Fortune. All agree, that no man can Accompliſh himſelf with them: Folly is no good Tutour to teach us Wiſdome: Neither can I conceive what bond of Friendſhip an Ingenious man can make with a Fool; all their qualities are ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that they cannot be ſuppoſed to be reconciled together. I think
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58553:116"/>there need not many arguments to diſſwade a Prudent perſon from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concern'd with ſuch a one; I can ſcarce believe that he is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him. When any one is taken with our Converſation, and Courts our Friendſhip, 'tis a great argument without doubt that he is much of the ſame Sentiments and opinion. Nature has not created Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bodies to be United; ſhe is a Miſtris that inſpires Paſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations more prevalent than our Reaſon. A Fool is fit for nothing but to divert an Ingenious perſon ſometimes; he may make a paſtime of him, but not a Friend. I could ſay, that he would ſerve very well to be cullied, if I would adhere to the opinion of many who believe, that men of parts ought to be maintain'd at his Expence. But this Maxime comes not within my precepts, as being contrary to Honeſty: I had rather that men ſhould avoid his Company, than cheat him. Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is upon all accounts Injuſtice: his weakneſs ought to move us to compaſſion, and his Holly ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58553:118"/>we have gathered together a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Stock of Money, let us get into the greateſt Gaming-houſes, and hold for a Maxime always to attaque the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt Purſes. I have heard a wiſe Gameſter, who had won a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Eſtate, profeſs, that for to reduce Gaming into an Art, he had found out no other ſecret, than to make himſelf Maſter of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to propoſe to himſelf this Exerciſe as a Trade of gaining Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, by diſcreetly managing his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and unfortunate hours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being tranſported or dejected: His reaſon was, that Chance being the Soul of Gaming, it would not be Chance, if it did not oftentimes change; that every thing has its continuance, which although un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, does yet come within the reach of the Rules of our Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Your good Fortune does vex and trouble him that looſes againſt you: Venture at whatſoever he ſets you, ſo long as you can anſwer it out of his Stock: the more he looſes, the leſs he will be capable of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his bad Fortune; Paſſion preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58553:119"/>him into a blindneſs, of which you ought to take an advantage; and if Fortune runs againſt you,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Grata ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniet, quae non ſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hitur hora.</hi>
                  </note> give her time to ſpit out her Venome, and do not ſet very much at once: propound to your ſelf a ſum to loſe, without hazarding any more; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your Stock, to re-unite your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and your laſt piece will bring back all your others, if you be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with paſſionate Gameſters. We ſeldome ſee a Gameſter want Money; as he looſes it with care, ſo he regains it with little trouble: There is a certain Charity among them, which does not permit them to deſert one another in diſtreſs. Although they have but three Dice for their whole Eſtate, and can give no other ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but Fortune, yet they will be ſooner entruſted with a conſiderable ſum of Money, than an honeſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. Moreover, this Gaming gives private Gentlemen admittance into the beſt Companies, and from thence an accompliſht perſon may draw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table advantages, if he can manage his affairs diſcreetly. It has alſo this quality peculiar to it ſelf, that for
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58553:119"/>the time it laſts, it makes all men equal; and every man has a right to diſpute his own intereſt, without giving place in any thing to the moſt honourable. I know ſome, who have no other Revenue, but three Dice and a Pack of Cards, who maintain themſelves in greater ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, than Country-Lords do by their vaſt and rich Mannours: But to arrive to this point, a long habit, and an exact knowledge of Gaming is required. If theſe Maximes do not always produce their effects, however they are conformable to Reaſon. Cheating is ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, and unworthy of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and is not to be endured by any gallant men. A Gentleman of my acquaintance diſcourſed one day very pleaſantly with a Monk; to whom he confeſſed, that when he dealt at Piquet, he could Shuſſle four Aces, or four Kings into the Stock, and that this trick had often ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very well. The good Father told him, that he was obliged to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore all the Money which he had won after this manner. The Genti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:58553:120"/>maintain'd the contrary, alledging this for his reaſon; that it was not more unjuſt to Shuffle the Cards well, than to play them well; and that his end that Shufflles, being to give himſelf a good game, and to break that of his Antagoniſt, he believed, that it ought not to trouble his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience if he gave himſelf a quatorze of Aces after the above-mentioned manner.</p>
               <p>After all, Cheating at play is very dangerous; it cauſes ſo many unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py accidents to beſal the Authors thereof, that it ought always to be avoided. I adviſe a man who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands and loves Play, to venture his Money; as he has but little to looſe, he will not hazard any great matter, and poſſibly may win much: but I would, as I have ſaid before, that he ſhould be able to contain himſelf, and not be Tranſported; that he ſhould make this a Science, and not a Paſſion; that he may look upon his loſs with moderation, and prudently husband his profits and Advantages. That which I aſſert is a great proof of Wiſdom, that is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58553:120"/>ſeldom met withal; and ſeeing the practiſe thereof is very difficult, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſionate men have prohibited Gaming, becauſe it produced contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effects in the greateſt part of our mindes, wherein Fury and a haughty humour are not capable of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs, which ſhould render it profitable to us, if we could but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it by the aſſiſtance of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak freely my opinion in all things after I have examined them; becauſe our Conduct is properly our own, and every one can perceive, whether he is capable of what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to him. I write neither for the Ignorant nor for the Obſtinate: let the Wilful take their own courſe, if they will not follow their Guide. Reaſon carries us ſafe by many Rocks and Precipices; but yet it cannot hinder them from being; and it would be a great folly not to dare to paſs over a Bridge, becauſe we might be Drowned if we ſhould fall over it. We finde no propoſitions, but what may be probably defended both ways: It behooves us therefore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58553:121"/>to follow that which ſeems the moſt reaſonable, and the moſt agreeable to our humour. For my part, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of Gaming in another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I practiſe it very little my ſelf, becauſe it does not divert me in the leaſt: I have this natural defect with many other, which the reſult of my Reaſon cannot correct. 'Tis Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures office to give us inclinations to Things, and to make us expert in their practiſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Whether the Knowledge and Exerciſe of Hunting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the making of a Fortune.</head>
               <p>HUnting is a very Innocent and Gentile Exerciſe; but it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome contributes to the Fortune of a Gentleman, unleſs it be in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue of the King or ſome great Prince, who delights very much in this Recreation. It is very good not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58553:121"/>to be altogether ignorant of it, and very dangerous to addict himſelf wholly to it. The beſt Hunts-men in the world could never boaſt of making a Fortune; 'tis not upon this Scent their dogs open; and though they can never give her a turn, they are reſolv'd to chace her, and not to hunt in ſight. They who exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love the Woods and ſolitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do not take the leaſt delight in the Society of Ingenious perſons: yet as every Childe is enamoured of his own Baby, the greateſt part of the Country Nobility believe, that the quality of Hunting is as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary to a Gentleman, as that of Witty and Valiant. For, to define an accompliſht and gallant man, they will tell you, that he keeps Dogs, and Hunting-Horſes, and goes every day a Courſing. They are not aware, that they define them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either what they really are, or what they would be accounted; and as their minde is wholly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with this Paſſion, they perſwade themſelves, that it ought to raign over all; and that it alone has the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58553:122"/>priviledge of compoſing a gallant and an accompliſht perſon.</p>
               <p>If my deſigne was to write of the difference of Pleaſures, I would not place this in the loweſt rank: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it has certain Charms, and ought to be ſo much the rather permitted, becauſe it is exempted from thoſe Vices, which ordinarily accompany other Recreation. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it is purely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; that it makes mens Bodies more agile; and when moderately uſed, it contributes very much to the Health. But my endeavours are to Conduct a Gentleman in the path of Fortune, and I do not ſee how this can be the ſafeſt or the beſt to be kept.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> That the Treaſurers are the moſt profitable Maſters.</head>
               <p>I Will now conclude with the laſt way, which is that which Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men commonly take, and which we deſert, although it be the Smootheſt, the Shorteſt, and the moſt Infallible of all: 'Tis the Retinue of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers, and the Employments which depend on their Charges. The daily experience which we have of their extreme Wealth, compels me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the uſefulneſs of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. It ſeems as if Fortune had no reverſe for them; and being elevated above her Wheel, they have nothing elſe to do, but load it with Gold, to hinder it from turning: I may ſafely ſay, that ſhe becomes their Slave; and the reſpect which ſhe bears them, paſſes even to the leaſt of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. Their Houſes reſemble Great Lakes, which traverſing through the more fertile grounds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Waters of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58553:123"/>and the neighbouring Plains. For to render himſelf well-qualified for theſe Employs, there is neither Learning, nor an extraordinary Wit required; diligence is the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification: But ſuch as the neceſſity of their affairs, or the deſire of raiſing their Fortunes, does cauſe to reſolve to ſeek ſuch Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; they muſt forget the glory of their Extraction, and trample Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry under their Feet; they muſt as the younger Brothers of <hi>Bretagne</hi> let their Nobility ly dormant, and not be too inquiſitive or curious to inform themſelves of the Extraction or parts of their Maſters, from whom they expect their advancement. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is a Monſter, which is to be vanquiſht with all ſorts of Weapons; it is dangerous to ſuffer her to be too long engaged with Generoſity; if that ſhould triumph over her, it would but obtain a Victory full of regret and Melancholy: let them then keep this ſotriſh glory ſilent, which holds the Reigns ſo ſtraight, that they cannot troop to a Man, whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has raiſed; let them rather
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58553:123"/>think, that they have an advantage by approaching to him; let them conſider, that a Diamond does not looſe its value when it is ſet in Steel; and that the Sun, as glorious as it is, ſometimes ſuffers Eclipſes: let them alſo take a great care not to confound Glory and Vanity together; the one is the recompence of Vertue, the other is an effect of our Folly. If Nature has made one a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and if the Laws of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or ſome other miſhap has rendred him poor; let him thank Heaven for his Extraction, and endeavour to remedy the unhappineſs of his Fortune: let him know, that Life without Wealth is a tedious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable affliction; that the yoak of Poverty is heavier than that of a Treaſurer; and that if he be inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, he may become as great a Lord as his Maſter: Then he ſhall revive his Quality, and from obſcure and hidden as it was in the Country, he ſhall render it glorious and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in the midſt of the Better ſort; let him not fear the reproach of having been Clerk or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58553:124"/>when they ſhall ſee him ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Privy Council.

And if you ask Reaſon, ſhe will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you, that ſhe concerns her ſelf onely to inſtruct men, and not to regulate the events of things. Thoſe who guide Travellers cannot aſſure them that they ſhall not meet with Thieves, that their Horſes ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtumble nor fall, that the Winds ſhall be favourable, and the Weather fair: Their Function is to ſhew them the beſt and directeſt way, but not to ſecure them from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of Robbers, or the injuries of the Weather. Humane Prudence has too weak a ſight to penetrate into general and particular Cauſes: notwithſtanding they are all deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and admit of nothing that is Fortuitous; yet their infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58553:125"/>ſurpaſſes our knowledge and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Poor <hi>Aeſchylus,</hi> whom the Stars threatned with a fall, that ſhould cruſh him to death under its weight, got but little by living in the open Fields, having no other Canopy but Heaven; an Eagle kill'd him by a great Tortoiſe, which it let fall upon the Bald Head of this unhappy Philoſopher.

               <p>The <hi>Pyrronians</hi> baniſht all cares and Prudence from the Conduct of Man's Life; they believed that they ought not to turn out of the Road when they met either a Cart or a Horſe, becauſe they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that every thing was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that the cauſes neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their effects; and that our Knowledge, uncertain as it is, was not capable of diſcovering them, for to avoid them: Moreover, they thought they ſhould offend Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by preſuming to prevent or alter her Eternal Decrees.</p>
               <p>But alas, how weak is our Reaſon in every thing, and how difficult is it to eſtabliſh one ſound opinion? Theſe poor people were not ſenſible,

Can your am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition be reconcil'd with Prudence, to deprive your ſelf, out of a gayety of humour, of that pleaſure which you perfectly enjoy without ſtirring from your Palace, to engage your ſelf in the moſt extreme perils for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Victory, and moſt inevitable Evils? Men might have ſaid as much to <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt; to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and to the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> A Prince by extending his Dominions, increaſes the ſound of his Name, and contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his repoſe; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, multiplies his cares and troubles by creating to himſelf new Enemies. Nevertheleſs, the World admires the Conquerours: there is no Divinity ſo reverenc'd, as the Valour of theſe illuſtrious Robbers, who ſacrifice the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58553:129"/>wealth, life, and liberty of men to their ambition. Men fear their arms whilſt they live; when dead, they praiſe them, nay ſometimes they are canoniz'd. Never was any thing ſo unreaſonable, but it found abettors. A famous Orator of <hi>Athens</hi> ſpent his life in making a Panegyrick of the third Ague. Poverty bereaves the whole World of its repoſe, and Riches raviſht it from <hi>Anacreon,</hi> in ſuch manner, that he return'd again to <hi>Polycrates</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Samos,</hi> the ten thouſand Ducats which he had preſented him, becauſe they diſturb'd his ſleep. As every one has his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Senſe, ſo every one has his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Folly; they follow their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament in this, as in all other things. There is great Probability,

The one made the principle of his Philoſophy to deride the World, and to make all ſerious things ridiculous; the other eſtabliſht his upon Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Tears: perhaps a third perſon would have been more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as leſs intereſſed. There are
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58553:129"/>few States governed by the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; they tend all to the ſame end, by divers ways. Religion it ſelf, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is, could never Univerſally be the ſame in all parts of the world. The diverſity of our judgements is the Origine of all theſe things; and ignorance, which is natural to us, is the Source of the diverſity of our judgements. Truth is ſo ſtately and majeſtick, that ſhe diſdains men, as being unworthy to behold her; ſhe conceals her ſelf under ſo many ſhapes, that there is hardly one wiſe man in an age, whom ſhe admits to her ſight: She communicates her ſelf unmask'd to Faith alone, becauſe that is the Creature of the Eternal Truth. 'Tis that which gives us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible leſſons for our Conduct, as well as for our Salvation; without it our Reaſon is blinde, and leads us into precipices: Her precepts are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways juſt, and her promiſes are never ineffectual. If we give ear to her, ſhe will tell us in two words the whole method we ſhould obſerve to advance our fortunes, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt of all ſeek the Kingdom of God; and all
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:58553:130"/>your affairs ſhall ſucceed happily. This precept is an admirable abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beſt Morality in the world, and deſerves both our belief and our conſideration. For what is it but to follow Vertue which guides us in the path, and ſlie Vice which leads us aſtray? The examination of this Propoſition ſhall make the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Vertue is a tendency of the Soul to Goodneſs, as to its natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; if we follow it, it will never lead us amiſs, nor where we ſhall meet with bad Fortune. I am very ſenſible, you will object, that honeſt men are not always the happieſt. To which I anſwer, If they be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertuous, you are deceiv'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they can be unfortunate: Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is the chiefeſt good, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtands not in need of other things for compleating the happineſs of her followers. If God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exalts the wicked, 'tis but to make the fall the more terrible, and the cataſtrophe the more remarkable.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58553:130"/>be violent, like as his life has been full of trouble and confuſion. Malice may be ſubtile and expert: ſhe is a Coward that takes all advantages, by which ſhe may ſometimes prevail againſt Vertue; but ſhe is utterly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined ſo ſoon as diſcovered: The eyes of a man of Honour, like a Baſilisk, kill her immediately. Although Vertue be in general the Exerciſe of a perſon of Honour, it does not hinder him from being more cunning and wiſer than a wicked man. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is one of the Retinue; 'tis ſhe which carries the Flambo to give light to the other Vertues; ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands how to incline the Prince's minde in favour of him whom ſhe ſerves. The Sincerity of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Juſtice of his Counſels, and the Fidelity of his Services, ſpeak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways advantageouſly of him; and Generoſity, which preſerves his Soul from being guilty of ignoble Acts, vigorouſly repulſes the attacks of his Enemies. There is ſo great an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Vertues, that they cannot be ſeparated. The abſence of one, cauſes the deſtruction of the reſt;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58553:131"/>becauſe they all tend to the ſame end. Honeſty is like the Ocean; this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the Rivers of the Earth, and that compiles all the Vertues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to frame an Honeſt and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man. God leaves ſecond Cauſes to act, as well as our Free Will; he has armed the Wiſe with Counſel and Reaſon; which would be in vain, if he ſhould deprive them of the Succeſs thereof, and grant nothing to our prudence.
